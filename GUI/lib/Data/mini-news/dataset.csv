" What are people's opinions about laser detectors?  Escort makes a laser detector, the Passport 1000, and claims it works fine.  However, I've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you are lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in front of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your detector.  Otherwise it won't work.  Regular radar, of course, travels in all directions; hence it is more detectable.  Any comments?  Escort has a deal (till the end of April, I think), where if you buy their wideband (Passport 3200 - X, K, Ka) and laser detectors, you'll save $60 off of buying them separately.  In this case, the addition of the laser detector over the Passport 3200 is only $40 (i.e. Passport 1000 normally costs $100). -- Eddie Gornish University of Illinois - Center for Supercomputing Research & Development  gornish@csrd.uiuc.edu ",sci.electronics

I guess this statement doesen't contradict what you said, though.  --- cut here ---          WASHINGTON (UPI) -- The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh start, President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation of Police Commisioners convention in Washington.         In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural, Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War ``would make everything so far seem so half-hearted that for all practical purposes this war is only beginning now.'' He repeatedly emphasized his view that ``regardless of what has been tried, or who has tried it, or how long they've been trying it, this is Day One to me.'' The audience at the convention, whose theme is ``How do we spell fiscal relief?  F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E,'' interrupted Clinton frequently with applause.         Clinton's program, presented in the speech, follows the outline given in his campaign position papers: a cabinet-level Drug Czar and ``boot camps'' for first-time youthful offenders.  He did, however, cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement methods.  ``This year's crime bill will have teeth, not bare gums,'' Clinton said.  In particular, his administration will place strict controls on data formats and protocols, and require the registration of so-called ``cryptographic keys,'' in the hope of denying drug dealers the ability to communicate in secret.  Clinton said the approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground economic activity, such as ``the deficit-causing tax evaders who live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren.''         Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won ``because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last November, everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of urgency about fighting the drug menace.  The advocates of legalization -- the advocates of surrender -- may be very good at making noise,'' Clinton said.  ``But when the American people cast their ballots, it only proved what I knew all along -- that the advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe.''

You >don't need six feet of lead to make decent shielding; your dead skin >cell layer does an excellent job on alpha particles, and neutrons >are slowed by mere *water*.  What do you think 75% of you is?  But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the neutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would  also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.  As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate.  >>  Plus these things have no self- >>defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as >>a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use >>(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration >>(translation:  cities and population centers).  >	If the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal >government, they are indeed useful weapons to the militia.  I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American  revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for  example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that.  There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a  disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.

I wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the ""Clipper"" system is easily justified ""Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever."" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.

I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the ""Clipper Chip Proposal"" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the ""Big Brother Proposal"") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from ""experts"" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how ""tamper proof"" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the ""Clipper Chip Proposal"" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the ""Big Brother Chip.""   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like ""harmony,"" ""right to encryption,"" and ""voluntary.""   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is ""I can't believe it's happening here.""

Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as right-wing gun nuts, and just mixes up two issues.  I am one of the BATF/FBI critics, and yet I am a liberal and just as anti-gun as you are.  I just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights, even religious crazies. They're all human beings, not some nest of wasps that you're trying to exterminate.  The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original raid.  It was well known that Koresh regularly went jogging outside his property.  He could have been served with a search warrant then.  He could have been arrested if he had refused to comply.  Instead officers armed with grenades invaded the property.  This escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both sides.  Those were the first two mistakes:  the bad judgment of asking for a no-knock warrant, and the bad and probably illegal way the already-unwise warrant was served.  At this point, the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis. That's when the government started covering their traces, sealing the warrant, revising their reported history of the incident, etc.  Things were already building up to disaster.  Now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and waited.  But according to Janet Reno, that option had ""never been seriously considered"".  So, supposedly because the agents were ""frustrated and fatigued"", and because there supposedly were no backups, they felt they had to go in.  Now it's entirely possible that Koresh was responsible for the fire.  If that's so, he deserves the blame for the deaths of the people in his compound.  But the government's hands are far from clean. Their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus contempt for the 4th amendment.  The motivations for the second raid are just too unbelievable. And their coverup of the events of the first raid undermines their credibility in anything they do thereafter.  We have only some very biased FBI agents' word for what happened.  And please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun discussion.  Anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government agents.  And Koresh's civil rights exist whether his guns were legal, illegal, illegal-but-should-have-been-legal, or whatever!    --  Rob Strom, strom@watson.ibm.com, (914) 784-7641 IBM Research, 30 Saw Mill River Road, P.O.

Armenians DO REMEMBER of the TURKISH invasion of the Greek island of >CYPRESS WHILE the world simply WATCHED.   And the 'Turkish Karabag' is next. As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

" Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for $649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining 5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.  Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware problem.  Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one, but they said ""no."" Also, within three weeks after I purchased my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.  I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.)  It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.   I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)  What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any other products from La Cie in the future.  Bill Krauthammer f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu  PS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service has been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.  ",comp.sys.mac.hardware

Uh, the original author's point was that black and white players were por- trayed differently by ""the media"", and towards this, he gave a highly selected list to ""prove"" his case.

I dispute that Sanders has ever been called lazy by ""the media"".   >>Hmm, big ego, possible club house disturbance, etc. Is that GOOD press? > >No, but it isn't the total extent of the press he received in >Pittsburgh, where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and >spoiled by the local columnists.

Uh, that poster specifically stated ""allow me to be the first"". It is NOT a quibble, then, to state that ""the media"" did not portray Canseco as being  lazy. If the other person chooses to so accuse him, after my post, that does not make it a quibble. And in fact, the media around here tend(ed) to play up his time in the wieght room. Hardly ""lazy"", and hardly a ""quibble"". Have you ever seen any ""mediot"" portray Canseco as ""lazy""? Unconcerned with his fielding, yes. Lazy, no.  >>>bad fielder, I think this is still interesting.

Having said that, I have to say >that the selective reporting hypothesis has the potential to be >unfalsifiable, at least by those of us who aren't reporters, police, >or private investigators.  Well, Canseco has been involved in several felonies, including his high-speed record, carrying concealed fire-arms, and of course the domestic violence.  Clemens had a run-in at a bar. Canseco had that, as well, and in both cases, the coverage was relatively minimal.  >>Puckett? Stewart? Jackson?  > >I said ""over-represent"" non-whites.

Indurkhya                        TUTORIAL PROGRAM Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on  Tuesday, July 6.  12:00-2:45pm ""Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer   Scientists""  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University)  This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is  intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists  who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.   Material covered will include structural and informational  molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic  material, the ""central dogma"" of gene expression, and selected  other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as  relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has  appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and  has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition  to his current work in computational biology.  12:00-2:45pm ""Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for   Biologists""  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)  An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be  presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological  applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming  languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as  selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge  representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended  audience includes biologists with some computational background,  but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr.  Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has  worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to  biological problems in both academia and industry.  3:00-5:45pm ""Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory   in Biological Sequence Analysis"" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos   National Laboratory)   This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of  intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine  learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely  interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical  neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general  characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such  approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic  views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical  Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such  techniques in this domain.  3:00-5:45pm ""Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming""   Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)  The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly  non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally  inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both  the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and  characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an  extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size  and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will  also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to  biological applications, and to identifying resources and software  that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza,  a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught  this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in  the field.  3:00-5:45pm ""Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis""   Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania)   & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)  Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies  are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of  tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic  pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of  genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the  identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes  in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and  functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty  appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn,  represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order  syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski  has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area  of word-based analyses.

" While one may question the motives of the Arabs who sold land to Jews, often while publicly criticizing the sale of land to Jews, it was the Jews and not the Arabs who were taken advantage of, as the prices the Jews paid for barren land was many times the price fertile land was being sold for in the United States at the same time. --  Alan H.

" About two years ago I posted the following:   I am planning to write a new book called ""Great Canadian Scientists."" Please forward your nominations to me: shell@cs.sfu.ca   The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen. They don't have to be born in Canada or even live in Canada, but they must have (or have had, if they are dead) Canadian citizenship while they are/were great Canadian scientists.   About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the end of this posting.   I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness, and there may be a gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, I would be pleased to hear them. In any event, please nominate people even if you are not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible.   Please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, so that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above, then give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist.   After I have the list, I will choose about six of the most interesting ones and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy Kidder's ""Soul of a New Machine"" or some other dramatic technique. The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with  one paragraph biographies.   If you have any other ideas about this project, I am interested to hear them.   So far, I have received 68 nominations as follows:     First Name     Last Name      Nominator            Famous For ----------     ---------      ---------            ---------- Sid            Altman         Kuszewski, John      Catalytic RNA(Nobel Chem 89) Frederick      Banting        me                   Insulin (Nobel U23 medicine) Davidson       Black          Stanley, Robert      Discovered Peking Man James R.

It's amazing to see just how much was discovered by Canadians. Actually there are many more who were born in Canada, but became Americans after graduate school.   Please note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. Now I know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again.   If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drop me a line. ==================================================   That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from Science Culture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the book. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about 40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of the scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist, ""What I was doing when I was 12"", So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There  will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well.   I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close  to being it. Hope to find one soon.    I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the pure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of  the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed.   I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists, and to discuss what is ""great"" what is ""Canadian"" and what is ""scientist"".

"  Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.   The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building, and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience.  I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun. At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work, but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),  The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe). The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres.  The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.    The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.

As far as I am concerned, I am not ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for his first promise and his last promise.  The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given  NATIONAL exposure.  Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally, in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all.  And even then, they cleverly  cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded ""national exposure,"" but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it.  The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript. We'll never know if he would have kept that one.  > 	The FBI etc. can't wait forever for Koresh to come out.

A lower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible- distribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The ACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action protected the ""religious neutrality of our public schools."" He also said that schools must serve students of ""all faiths and none."" Schools were not to be a ""bazaar where rival religious groups compete for converts,"" according to Lynn.  Several Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in hospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on sidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools. They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their children receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to continue their work at a distance, but find the school's position somewhat disheartening.  I understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, I can see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other hand, when does ""neutrality"" become ""nihilism?"" When does plurality turn into no position at all?  I see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms but not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.  The other is that while we are seeking ""religious neutrality"" in our schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced ""religious neutrality"" for the past seventy years--are making the  Bible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St. Petersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100 public school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had requested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the students and are given class time to explain its contents. I remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and speaking to the university students standing under a statue of Lenin. Now, that's ironic!  I admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths have equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like atmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions and provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public arena acknowledges it as valid.  However--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the distribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our schools only signals once again our culture's movement away from a singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make moral and ethical decisions.

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.  If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which you have to XOR together to recover the program...  Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem, no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.  That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to a Senator...).  > Anyway, its looking like the > keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA > can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number.  I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure, they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.  I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other.   		--Steve Bellovin ",sci.crypt

In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so.

What are your thoughts on it?    I read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name on the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really offensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or publisher), and read it, ""cover to cover"" (to use a phrase that seems popular here right now).  And I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but it was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in New Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English: the ""yaar"" at the end of a sentence, ""Butbutbut,"" the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)  At the time I still ""sorta-kinda"" thought of myself as a muslim, and I couldn't see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this was allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives, and had not (as my grandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes; in short, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely.  (And I won't mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)  Perhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity need an agent? She can come directly to me, can't she? How do we know that Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up, or put in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four women, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to suppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some ""holy"" guy. Not to mention murder the author.)  >Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim >posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book >and had called it such things as ""filth and lies"", ""I would rank >Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse"", and so on.  I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really silly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read ""Mein Kampf?"" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don't they just read the book and decide for themselves?

X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below) Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below) Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X	Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname:	your name Xorg:	School/Company/Organization Xaddr:	postal address X	use tab indented lines to continue X	don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entry's remarks should include: X	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X	       digit, followed by '.c' X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X	       title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X		obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.   X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user, X       special owner or group) are not allowed. X     X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

Send us a version of  X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y"" X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books (""The New Hackers Dictionary"") and on T-Shirts. X X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.

The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my ""car circle"" is that the  suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current Cobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior. After the MN12 (Thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, Ford decided  independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in  a volume car.    The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version of the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.  Ford is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority.   Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new Camaro/Firebird, IMO.    I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will  achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird.  The way GM loses money, the temptation to ""just get them out the door"" for the sake of positive cash flow will be  great once demand really takes off.    Tim Gardner   ",rec.autos

"Sender: nntp@mizar.usc.edu Message-ID: <1qll47INNlr3@mizar.usc.edu> NNTP-Posting-Host: mizar.usc.edu  Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.   Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.   Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Webster.   Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards. The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by Offerman.   By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc.   Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third.   My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.   Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.   Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday.   Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that.   Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?). Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year.   The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits. Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.   Dodger  ",rec.sport.baseball

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  Firstly, I am an atheist. I am not posting here as an immature flame start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.  The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live  in fear of what will happen when I  die.     I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.               I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.    <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.    Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  ""Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness."" For all of you ""found jeezus"" , how many of you were ""on the brink?""  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a ""non-believer"", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.  I must go.  These are but a few of my thoughts on Christianity.    --  //Damien Endemyr the Unpure Knight of Doom                          // //""So I've acquired a taste for blood and have adopted a nocturnal  // //lifestyle.

It doesn't mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire league by days of the week, nor that there should be.  But it doesn't mean we can't make predictions based on that for that particular player.  >>I believe that by >>season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations >>will be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch >>situations.

" Someone writes: >I found a list of Biblical contradictions and cleaned it up a bit, but >now I'd like some help with it.    I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve. Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality, an ""argument from article length.""  And the list you have here is of poorer quality than most.  Since the quotes seem to be taken from an on-line bible, I doubt that there will be much problem with verses quoted inaccurately.  But that isn't the problem here.  I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life, but none who denied that there were errors in transmission, etc.  And many of the contradictions here -- Solomon having 40,000 horse stalls in one verse, and 4,000 in another -- are just the sort of contradiction that fundies don't have a problem with, in my experience.  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount to anything more than attacking a straw man?  Some of the others are just silly, or rely on taking quotes out of context, or have reasonable explanations.  But even the ones that are genuine contradictions need to have more said about them than what is given here.  (At the very least, some effort should be made to understand and respond to the common replies given by fundies.)  Look for example at the research that Dave Butler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre. That would be an excellent start for an anti-inerrancy list that would have some teeth.  (One well-researched and documented contradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken out of context and thrown together in a list.)  Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together to make a bible verse salad just don't cut it.  Those of us who want to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thing as embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell.  dj  P.S. You can find some good material at ftp.rutgers.edu in /pub/soc.religion.christian/others/contradictions.  The quality is very uneven on both sides of the argument (it is just a compilation of things many people have written), but some of it would be useful in an anti-inerrancy FAQ.  After exams, I might be willing to help put it together. ",talk.religion.misc

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems.  Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware (modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.  None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe (no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by ""holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up"" - Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.  Beyond this Apple suggest that "" you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this Duo"". Since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line - and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230 purchasers who have this problem.  Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome, particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)  cheers  brucet  --            bruce tulloch sydney australia - brucet@extro.ucc.su.oz.au ***complex problems have straight forward, easy to understand wrong answers*** ",comp.sys.mac.hardware

I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes the situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my truck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet  says that the noise is ""a characteristic of the transmission.""  Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the gear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third, the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for ""engine longevity"" reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does. Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times  so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between stabilizer and control arm fell off).  Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What really bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for  them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never buy another Chevrolet.  jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com ",rec.autos

"Nntp-Posting-Host: sunspot.ece.clarkson.edu  It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a police agency.  It just might be a bad idea for them, too.  OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they now need to      (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of        the key.  Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics, while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost, statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license?]  There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house,  how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and  it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved,  how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of  these kinds of problems will be open for public or ""expert"" scrutiny?]    Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around,  even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be  an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a  key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political  embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:      (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and        turns the results over to the NY State Police.  But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.  I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain.

" One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration body is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good reason.  When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix the problem.  Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason. Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The auditee can say, ""Well, you told us this way would be OK.""  It compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's job.  Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar. Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets away that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court. But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.  There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.  I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again today, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU conflict of interest.  As always, my opinions are my own.  Lynn Grant Grant@Dockmaster.NCSC.MIL ",sci.crypt

"Distribution: world Message-ID: <Cohen-270493073219@q5022531.mdc.com> NNTP-Posting-Host: q5022531.mdc.com  The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already, but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....  Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign, based on information provided by NASA headquarters.  The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held.  The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:  ¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so-called ""Bus-1 spacecraft,"" the orbiter and Spacelab.  The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.  Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S. Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.  ¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option, from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data Management System.  Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.  Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the U.S. lab.  Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.  Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and propulsion systems.  The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module, a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.  Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and operations costs, he said.  ¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C, the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after ET separation.  The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000 cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 ""decks"" connected by a centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules, and other elements.  This ""can"" would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial attitude.  In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.  Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA.  Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the Soyuz TM spacecraft.  The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will be available to the SRT through May 5.  Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various management options have been developed including:  ¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of command.  ¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate Administrator.  ¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located hand-picked program office.  ¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an element of the current program.  ¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.  The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.  As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations.  What's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday and Tuesday at which point the design will be ""frozen"" to begin the detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to be held May 3.  Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to consult with the SRT.

Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for bus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4. EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.    So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does not.    --  ""Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.""   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me.

No. The library at Alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever built in the world. The Greeks had a love of wisdom, philo sophos, and this great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library. The Christians  got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems  invaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling  into Moslems hands (far more likely since they were the book burners, not the  Moslems), or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned it.  Either way, a tremendous amount of information was lost.

I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more  than most.  The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you  some insight into where Koresh got his theology.  Tammy ",soc.religion.christian

If I wanted to know the ""truth"" about, say, the specific gravity of chicken soup, I could  employ science -- meters, gauges, scales, etc. -- or I could just talk a walk  on a beach somewhere. Both have a possibility of generating the truthful  answer -- in the case of the walk on the beach, it would have to be some sort  of sudden inspiration about the specific gravity of chicken soup which just  happened to be truthful -- so what makes me choose the scientific method of  truth-determination over the ""walk on the beach"" method?

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  Jesus isn't God ? When Jesus returns some people may miss Him ?  What version of the Bible do you read Mike ?  Jesus is God incarnate (in flesh) . Jesus said, 'I and the Father are one.'  Jesus was taken up to heaven after His 40 day post-resurrection stint and the angels who were there assured the apostles that Jesus would return the same way and that everyone will see the coming. That's why Jesus warned that many would come claiming to be Him but that we would know when Jesus actually returns.

If  whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest (RC only apparently) is required.

(As usual, the current edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  I do know that the priest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be required.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid any ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The community provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of their commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public commitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular marriage.  Where I'm not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in exceptional cases (""valid but irregular"").  Ne Temere (1907) says that no marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according to the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new canon law retains this, but I'd rather see a more recent and authoritative source.  Note that while a Catholic priest is required for Catholics, the Catholic church does recognize marriage between baptized non-Catholics as valid without a priest.  --clh] ",soc.religion.christian

Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that  the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.

" 	Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway in world champs. After two periods the score was still 0-0. This game was  quite much similar to the first game Finland played  (against France). The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third period Juha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so. The second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoff behind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first point of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game- prize.

We don't seek to do God's will because we're forced to, we follow His way  because His way is best.  The reason it's hard is because we are flawed, not  because He's unreasonable.

" I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac. We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good advice.  We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk, and an unusable floppy drive. We also have a new spare Connor 40MB disk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some problems:  The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk drive.  If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each (1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?  Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?  What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them installed in the other disk.  The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets ID #1. The old one should have ID #0.  It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk.

" I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip to Moscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

The course of studies will last only 50 days, but during this time you will have the unique opportunity: 	- to listen to intensive courses on the main aviation disciplines, the history and theory of techniques, and design of airplanes; 	- to visit and get acquainted with the world known Russian  aviation firms - TU, MiG, Yak, Il and Su; 	- to meet and have discussions with famous aviation scientists, engineers and pilots; 	- to visit the most interesting museums of unique aviation techniques which were closed for many years to the public; 	- to see the International Airspace Show which will take place in Moscow from 31 August through 3 September 1993; 	- to visit famous art museums, historical and architectural monuments, theatres and concert halls; 	- to take part in sport competitions and have a great time with new friends.  The Director of the school is Mr. Oleg Samelovich, a well known Russian scientist, professor, general designer and the Chief of the Airplanes Design Department of the Moscow Aviation Institute.  Mr. Samelovich is one of the designers of the the Su-24, Su-25, and Su-27  The lectures are given in English, using a multi-media concept.  The students are provided with all the necessary text books and literature.  After the full course of studies are completed, the student will receive a special certificate of graduation.  The cost of studies, including hotel, meals, excursions, theatres, etc is $3500.

I figured on substituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the antenna coil, etc., myself.  The only problem I seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning capacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which used to be the mainstay for tuning circuits.  Well these things seem to be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  Trimmer capacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this application.  So, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the  0--360 pF range?

The number bounces between 2% and 18%, depending on the study quoted and the type of gun being studied.  Some cites:  ---------------------------------------  A recent BATF study (titled ""Protecting America, Yes"") surveyed 471 career  criminals and found that only 7% of guns used in violent crimes were purchased from retail dealers.  ---------------------------------------  National Institute of Justice Research in Brief  November 1986                          The Armed Criminal in America                               by James D. Wright  (1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct     sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.  Only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a licensed firearms dealer.  The remainder -- five out of six -- obtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving friends and associates, family members, and various black market outlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sources included cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and often theft.  The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.  ---------------------------------------  INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 4- 91 Independence Institute 14142 Denver West Parkway #101 Golden, CO 80401  (303) 279-6536                WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY                              By David B. Kopel       The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville. The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous criminals.[51]  In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.  51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal Enforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of 20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions; of those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who committed crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted) (of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony convictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum to Director, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony records who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or non-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted).  ---------------------------------------  INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 12-91                            THE ASSAULT WEAPON PANIC:                       POLITICAL CORRECTNESS"" TAKES AIM                             AT THE CONSTITUTION                        By Eric Morgan and David Kopel       Testimony before Congress revealed that most ""assault weapons"" in the hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97}  The testimony is consistent with the National Institute of Justice's research findings based on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored by sociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The figures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the criminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents of gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and probably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of guns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime directly target the black market in criminal guns, and leave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly, Wright believes that the consequences of current ""assault weapon"" legislation on street violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that gun controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new business.{100}  6.   _See, _e.g., The Anti-drug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989.

" [discussing the use of IRQ 7]  In  recent article msprague@superior.mcwbst311b (Mike Sprague) writes:  >I as a number of poeple in this thread have already written >(I can't prove it's true, but I believe it), LPT1 does not >actually use IRQ7, even though that interrupt is supposed to >be dedicated to LPT1.  To put it a little differently:   - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the    printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.   - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's    time to send out another byte to the printer.   - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable    the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between    the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the    IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it    in the high-impedence mode.   - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate    drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines    rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't    assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes    the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically     disconnected by a jumper.     (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold    the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true    you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and    that certainly isn't a requirement.)   - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the    proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance    reasons.    And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.  Joe Morris / MITRE  (jcmorris@mitre.org) ",comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

People turned out to watch him play.   I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks.  But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase  will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking one.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support them.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.    >Also, the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87.   Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book.   >They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is  >true.

An >increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival >of Mario Lemieux is what did it.   You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that it wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e. a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back and read from where this thread started...  It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it ""gee, Mario Lemieux is amazing, I'll go watch him play"", or was it ""gee, now we've got a *kick* *ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play"".  I think it was the latter.  > Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before >Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.  They >are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement >since Gretzky's first year there.  How do you explain it?  People are going >to see Gretzky.  they certainly aren't going to see a winner, they haven't >GOT a winner.  They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than >they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then.  I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to the games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket holders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings initial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source) and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.    Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like McNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold.  >I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend >winning as the major drawing power.    For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they make people around them better.  >But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)  Well, at least we are in full agreement here!  >This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren't  So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>  >getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge >jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne. >They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because >they are winning.  Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels?

" Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library. For Network discussion...  Color Coordination...      I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the   year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow   (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no   one responded at all.      The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly   you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself   solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead   of applications that actually require the colors for proper working.   ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers,   Animation, Real Time video, Raytracers, etc... .      The following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use.   Icons, Window Managers, and general applications, should follow this   table or something like it, UNLESS the application is ``color needful''.       * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors              EG: values   0, 128 and 255.        This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the        standard colors for use in icons.       * two extra shades of grey              EG: vales    (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...)       * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading        a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager.

This article will just scratch the surface of a few security considerations, comments are requested. (email: fw@world.std.com) My thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from Oracle Corp.  The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit  features or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$ included suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to  use table views to refine the granularity of access control.  One important security consideration in networked installations is that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user authentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the  _least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably  not define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access  of OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle  servers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv option), while relying on host security for local processes.   Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic)  audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and data access. These tools can be used to track the primary security risks from within the Oracle environment.  Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES encryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone to cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate  since the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users  choose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access  to your oracle database files through the host operating system,  s/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply  cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.  As security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity. Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files, s/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break  the passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without alerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail which would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix) provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not  guessable.   As with all computer security, the most important defense is to  educate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques are well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual,  (both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System  Security (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992)     Forrest Whitcher                 fw@world.std.com Boston Scientific Corp.

" I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different PEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's _PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).  I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures, hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)  The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize ""stitching"" artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed. Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid.  Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.  This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair ""backwards"" (i.e. smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.  I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer, typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers). Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching.  But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines ""show through"" areas which they are supposed to lie behind.  I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation; this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX 5.1.  Open questions:     (1) Why does this happen?         --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?         --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines             as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which             could be corrected for?         --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their             interpolators?         --  Something else?     (2) What to do about it?         --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision             in Z-buffered HLHSR?         --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching             artifacts?         --  Am I just out of luck?  Any help would be immensely appreciated!  --  =============================================================================== Dave Gorgen                         Internet: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com Applicon Inc.                                 gorgen@aaaca1.sinet.slb.com Ann Arbor, Michigan (USA)               UUCP: ...!uunet!sharkey!applga!gorgen ",comp.graphics

Some say this, some say >that.   > >     How can the bulk of the people be informed, when they won't read >     informative publications?  Because much of the public aren't even aware of the NAMES of informative publications.  Look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand. Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment, with the usual trade journals, all they ever see is the media (note: media in this context is the popular media - TV, radio, daily newspapers, and such publications as Time, Newsweek, and all that).  And they all say pretty much the same thing.  I see most of them being in the range of center-left to far Left, and generally supportive of pie-in-sky we-will-take- care-of-you-think-for-you-cradle-to-grave.  There seems to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of understanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them (as with Clipper, for example) or tells the people how to interpret events in others.  What is lost sight of is that the people are not good at understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information about them.  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be clarirvoyant.  For example, I would have been unaware of Clipper had I not picked it up on USENET.  How much of the population has USENET, let alone Internet access?  For access to better publications, the person has to spend time digging. Many folks, especially who work long hours, have families, etc., do not have TIME to go digging, and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong, so are not motivated to dig.  Not saying its right, just saying that is the way things are.  People aren't upset about things when they aren't TOLD.  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the problem.  And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service (bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without political connections, or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few if any rights, being a resource to be used by those in control for their polticial or financial gain.  Some Law Enforcement agencies act as if they regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt, peons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD, and get very nasty when someone questions them.  The media pundits/editors, etc tend to fall into those with privilege, and tend to not be upset by the current state of affairs.  The fellow in DC, who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzi for daring to swim in it, with an ILLEGALLY owned gun (violating the law he pushed to be foisted on everyone else), ends up walking where a less well-connected person would have been crucified.  A typical example of one standard for 'us', a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'.  Perhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this, but the solution sure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what is going on, or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a position where one feels they are exempt or insulated.  Such as that hypocrite of a journalist in DC described above.  One notices that these less-than complimentary points about that double-standard was NOT covered in the media.  I feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political views on the subject, and it involved a 'brother' journalist.  Isn't it time for our 'objective' media, the MAIN SOURCE of info for the average person, to start being what they claim to be, instead of spin doctors for the Statist elements?  >--  >Rahul Dhesi <dhesi@rahul.net> >also:  dhesi@cirrus.com   --  pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA          If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat WISDOM: ""Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,          and I am not sure about the former.""              - Albert Einstien ",sci.crypt
" > > What is a general rule of thumb for sobriety and cycling? Couple hours after >you ""feel"" sober? What? Or should I just work with ""If I drink tonight, I >don't ride until tomorrow""?  This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity to listen to some of the ""creative excuses"" offered the judge by others.  After listening to a number of ""Well, I was passing a very slow truck that suddenly speed up"" versions, I decided that the judge had heard just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than impressed with any of them.  This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper. He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.  The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose and said in his sternest voice: ""Well son, those are some pretty fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for your self?""  ""Well Sir"", meekly the defenant replied, ""I just was over to my buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home."" He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and was doing 110 mph on his way home.  The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him to attend remedial drivers training school.

" One presumes the system could work as follows:  a) Blank clips are manufactured by Mykotronx and VLSI.  The number produced is carefully audited and they are shipped to the first escrow house.  It programs the chips with its half the key, and prints out a paper slip with the key half and non-secret chip serial number.   The reams of paper are filed in locked boxes in the vault, a fuse is burnt in the chip so that the key is now unreadable.  The chip then goes to the next escrow house, where the same thing is done.  This continues through N escrow houses, perhaps, could be more than 2.  The last one provides the chip to the cellular phone maker.

" I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?  First Base:  Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations, then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs  Second Base:  Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge to Cubs...a big edge.  Shortstop:  Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an automatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.  Third Base:  Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter. Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to Florida.  Catcher:   Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to Marlins  Left Field:  Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential. I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.  Center:  Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May isn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays full time.  Right:  Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs  Starters:  Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs  Middle Relief:  Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins. Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.  Closer:  A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save. Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.  Overall, an edge to Chicago. Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course. e -- msilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu				GO CUBS!!!

"  	------------------------------------- 	+ ............The OTIS Project '93  +       	+ ""The Operative Term Is STIMULATE"" +  	------------------------------------- 	---this file last updated..4-21-93---   WHAT IS OTIS?  OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind ""digital immortality"" is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.      	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site 		 	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite  	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely ""anonymous FTP"" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the ""bin"" command to make sure you're in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff... 	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines 	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5"" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this ""info-file"" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the "".rm"" file for     the image or series of images...or in the ""Artists"" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in ""dos"" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit ""code"" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:   	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That's about it for now.  More ""guidelines"" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS    	     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest, 	     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations 	     however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original   	     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.   	     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone 	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.       	     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS 	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights 	     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to  	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed  	     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed      	     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is 	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or 	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not  	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,         	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific 	     permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is ""stimulate"".  If you know of people that'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm in the booty....offer them free food...whatever...  ....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)        (ed@sunsite.unc.edu)  -- Ed Stastny           | OTIS Project, END PROCESS, SOUND News and Arts  PO BX 241113	     | FTP: sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS) Omaha, NE 68124-1113 |      141.214.4.135 (projects/otis) ---------------------- EMail: ed@cwis.unomaha.edu, ed@sunsite.unc.edu ",comp.graphics

A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths, and not attempt to affect childhood falls, drownings, gunshot injuries, etc.???????????????? So this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease, chronic lung disease, homicide, HIV infection, or diabetes.  Oh, okay Charles, that makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES of death.  And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes. Please, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles.   I've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents group or talk.politics.fall group?  This is talk.politics.guns.  Don't confuse the issue.  Just because a social problem may not claim as many victims as another, we should not try to address it?  I don't agree. I'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of childhood deaths. I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths is trying to make a political issue out of it.     >> I assumed that any humane >> person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents >> gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends. > >A ""humane person"" who keeps a firearm in the house with a 10 year old >would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm; >Ignorance is our greatest enemy. >  Again Charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context for your own purposes.  The statement that you responded to above is actually in reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed concern over making youth gun violence a priority.  I guess, maybe Humane person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh? Both would be defined as ""a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest number of childhood deaths.""  If that is the case, I'm extremely glad that I am inhumane and irrational.   >>  Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence >                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >What _other_ sources of information do you have which confirms their >data?  These folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts. >Perhaps you can verify their data with the Uniform Crime Report... > Sorry Charles, the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting the facts.  But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, ""Firearm murders of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990""   Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state that ""Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun accidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded"".   Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say ""Gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between 1987 and 1990.""   Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state that ""Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from 1986 to 1988.""   Charles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don't realize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.  Its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political discussion.

As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact with many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  In addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids.  Ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot, whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and whether they themselves have ever been shot.

I am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take Paul's illustration about one body / many parts far too narrowly. It is easy to say that the one body represents a particular sect of Christianity (generally our own), and the parts are clearly the various offices of ministry. There is a place for that. But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a wide variety of doctine - Catholic, Protestant, liberal, conservative, Orthodox, etc. - I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the context of the 'body of Christ.' And I am equally sure that one day, after we shug off this mortal coil, when we no longer see through a glass darkly but see clearly, face to face, we will all be ashamed at some of the things we held as truth. We ought all fellowship, worship, and serve where we are called, and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone else is called.  One of the fathers of the reformation (help me out - can't recall the name) put it quite succiently:  	In essentials, unity. 	In nonessentials, liberty. 	In all things, charity.  While I agree with Lewis (Mere Christianity) that calling oneself a Christian implies some basic, fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean anything at all, I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit too broadly, deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those bounds, and ignore the requirements of charity all together.   Me? I attend a Vineyard church, speak in tongues, am effectively an inerrantist, though I'll grant some inaccuracy in translation, am moderately pre-mill, and evangelical. But, I'm not ready to damn those who use icons, say mass in latin, uphold the Virgin Mary (though I really don't believe that she was sinless), vote on Church membership, or insist on baptism for salvation. Of course, I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth - why would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth? But my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually evolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him, studying His word, and fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.                       --T.S.

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File	   Size in bytes		Comments  ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress 			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. 			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) 			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) 			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing 			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just ""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with ""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means ""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"", ""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared"" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say ""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to ""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  	""begin"" line 	M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  	""begin"" line 	M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.  --  			tom lane 			organizer, Independent JPEG Group Internet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu	BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie ",comp.graphics

Apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isn't as strong  as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger.  Hurt found that a surprising number of accident-involved motorcyclists hadn't used their brakes at all prior to impact.    I think the only way you'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in  a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you ever use, and to practice it constantly, even when you have no need to do any turning.  If you follow me down a long straight, and I seem to be  wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need, it's because I'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in my path.  All of this practice may indeed be futile, but if I have even milliseconds to react, the most *familiar* tactic available (and hopefully  the most automatic) will be countersteering.  The same logic applies to braking with the front brake, of course.  Chuck Rogers car377@torreys.att.com ",rec.motorcycles

Sounds a bit >>tacky, but hey, whatever works.  As David Veal points out, this sort of ""promotion"" would be used against gun owners by the mass media.  However, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area, free, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40 or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.  Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished teaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been very well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices interested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but feel they should know something about ""gun safety"" since members of their family keep guns at home.  Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:  (1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases     firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.  (2) A ""gun safety"" class is Politically Correct, and likely to     be viewed positively by the public and the media.  (3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)     and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a     gentle introduction to firearms.  (4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun     and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.  (5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners     in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,     non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate     the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun     students sometimes tell us they have ""something new to think     about"" with regards to personal gun ownership.  (6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.  Our course is the standard NRA-certified ""Home Firearm Safety"" class, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also teach the NRA's ""Personal Protection"" class, although the cost is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.  I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to gun buy-backs.                                 -- Alane --    /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    ""I am a jelly doughnut""      \  /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \ /-----------------------------------------------------------------------\ ",talk.politics.guns

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol work better in migraine than tension-type headache.  The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got relief.

Can anybody help me out?  The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators, and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: ""Ctrl Any<Key>q"".  >In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says ""For information >on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4..."", this is so you >know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.

For >example, the translation: >	Shift<Key>q:	quit() >will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as >the Shift key (and the q key).  This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.  >Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?  If you mean ""menu accelerator"", no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.  >Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you >can't use XtInstallAccelerators().  I can't think of a reason why not.  >How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of >case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one >menu entry.  There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade 					  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton 							  - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\     Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\     Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)  You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.  -- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com) ",comp.windows.x

BTW, railroad police sometimes use radar to check for speeding trains (just like regular police check for speeding cars), although the intent here is for safety, not revenue collection (unlike with cars).

" I just purchased The Norton Desktop for windows, and I also have Norton Utilities.  When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility.

This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:    1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.        i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?    2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?

The Oriental Orthodox Churches never even ""shelter"" Eutyches (the advocator of Monophysitism) but on the contrary, it condemned (and still does condemn) him and his heresy. That is why the Eastren (Chalcedonian) Orthodox Church held talks with the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) that started 30 years ago and still continueing till today, but they have converged on many issues the most imporatant of which is Christology (I have more  details of the inter-Orthodox dialogue, in case anyone is interested). So I do not see how the ""Alexandrians"" and the Nestorians are in a similar position.

If they aren't Atheists, >what are they?  When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving, communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion.   The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews, Mushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a din you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social code. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict, etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent those assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other Mushriq, or roughly polytheists.   There cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community, that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate  the society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or ""Progress is  the natural consequence of Human activity"" or ""parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government"", however  they individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point of view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist.  ""We are a atheist society"" in fact means ""we reject the din other than ours"".   Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/ suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such deviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point of looking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level.   I think it took more than one minute.  Kutluk ",alt.atheism

Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure from punishing people?  The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and his angels.  To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the Bible teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.  Their judgement is soon to come.  Let me suggest this.  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.

Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.    For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa,     Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.    There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.    Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us.     Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early    arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays    for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday    with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the    awards ceremony.       For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on     registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course    be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider < betting 70 +    needed to win> and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15>.    and greatest distance, one up & two up and all the usual things.

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.  Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.  There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try different things, some of which seem to help.  Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days. Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.  Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable) diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good doc.  ",sci.med

BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole  thing is going back.     I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.  I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?

Well, I used to get mad, and either try to communicate my anger to jerks, or to, uhm, educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic. Now I just try to get them off my tail.  In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the  jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.  In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass, I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name, (still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.    If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps  (for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.    A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case, yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike.   On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).  Like almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary.  -- Denis McKeon	 galway@chtm.eece.unm.edu ",rec.motorcycles
"  Hello,  	I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have   8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.   both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking   of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know   that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I   can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about   $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,   the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that   the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather   avoid...  So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work   well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about   $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how   do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the   extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the   ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so   probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly   appreciated.  -Eric  ebosco@us.oracle.com  ",comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

"  	Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape is harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are  very different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  While there is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to get your hands on and costs quite a bit.  	If you have access to an Amiga computer, that has an NTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by modem and tape them from the NTSC output.  Unfortunately, this would be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy animation unless you had a good Amiga animation program.

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of ""arrogance of Christians"" and look forward to any responses.  In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, ""All policemen are jerks!""  I'd ask, ""How do you know?""  ""Because my daddy told me so!""  ""How do you know you're daddy is right?""  ""He says he's always right!""  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  | Louis J. Kim                      ---  _ O                PH:512-522-5556 | | Southwest Research Institute    ---  ,/  |\/'            FAX:512-522-3042 | | Post Office Drawer 28510      ----      |__                 lkim@swri.edu | | San Antonio, TX 78228-0510   ----    __/   \    76450.2231@compuserve.com | --   [I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for other religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that doesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a ""historical"" religion.  That is, it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the ""mundane"" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't see how else we could proceed.  This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.  --clh] ",soc.religion.christian

" Please help.  I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.  While I was working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little, which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and all peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.  I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was completely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider still worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.  I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc., all to no avail.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the ""death"" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the net about this because I already know what they'll say: ""Yep, you gotta have this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???.""  I've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable life cycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the brand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz. I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down before coming in to work today.  If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm not opposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutely necessary.  If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu but if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days.  BTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feel free to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and name of the FAQ if you don't mind.

Never avoid a dog for the dog's sake, only you're own.    I hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic to this approach.

" REPOST:  I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled.  I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a ""fake"" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data.  Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?  Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

" As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question ""WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?"" I must assume that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.  She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ?  This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are: Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in  pet food?  ----------------------------------- I speak for myself and not Motorola -----------------------------------   --  Walter Lundby  ",sci.med

Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman  border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman  Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who  assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman  parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces  who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname ""Murad"",  especially ordering that            'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in            whatever circumstances you find them.

In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately, in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all  the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy  conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a  telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in  April 21, 1915, ""thanking it for its services to Russia."" The Armenian  newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly  reported in May 24, 1915 that   ""only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.""

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the  area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts   into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable   and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets   completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for   howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the   scattered bones of the dead.""

Are you people for real? The main legal principles of the Turkish State  are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:  	""The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State 	governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public 	peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights; 	loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental 	tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.""  Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution. The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856. Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.  The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government.  The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces.  During the Independence War, the ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" held their first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal  backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a  multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.  ""Major Principles of the Constitution""  The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles:  - The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by    law; - It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,   human rights and the objectives of Ataturk; - The language of the State is Turkish; - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.   Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation; - Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This   power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else; - Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers; - Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the   Turkish nation; - All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,   sex, or political beliefs; - Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.  ""Structure of the State""  In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the principle of ""division of power"" to create a balanced and self-controlled system. The power is divided into ""legislative power,"" ""executive power,"" and ""judicial power,"" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other (self-control).   A. Legislative Power:   The ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" is a parliament with one House, elected  by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on  behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:   - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;  - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;  - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;  - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;  - to ratify international agreements;  - to grant amnesty or pardons.   Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral  or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is  divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is  calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age  of twenty-one can vote.   Elections are supervised by the ""Supreme Council of Elections,"" which solves  all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local ""Board of Election""  runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the  Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among   independent judges.   B. Executive Power:   The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government  as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:   - to represent the State and the Country;  - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;  - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;  - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;  - to ratify laws and government decrees.    The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven  years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may   call for a referendum.   Executive power is exercised by the ""Council of Ministers,"" headed by the  Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the  members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval  by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their  program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)  Ministers in the Council.   Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent  ""administrative"" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or  functions against any law.   C. Judicial Power:   Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can  instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be   discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the  reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories  of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:   - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The     decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice    upon the appeal of the parties involved.  - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime    Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in    administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.    The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the    high administrative court.   The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the  ""Constitutional Court"" if they contradict the Constitution. If found  contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.

"  	Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasn't dealt with 	CGM, ASN.1, CDA, DCA, SGML, or any one of a number of other 	very successful file format.  People seem perfectly capable 	dealing with these others.  Dealing with the format of TIFF 	is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and 	FAX encoding of the image data.  The majority of the libraries 	which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather 	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters.  	Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather 	simpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest 	that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.  	That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about 	using it in many instances.  GIF is very nice for use in low-end 	photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would 	never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  FAX is nice, 	but it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well). 	JPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.  	The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle 	all these situations (and then some).  Naturally it's more complex. 	But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging 	systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday.  	You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes 	but please don't wrail against it's complexity.  The complexity 	it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and 	doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially 	viable file formats.   	If we're in philosophical arguments against complexity, let's all 	go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length 	encoding.   ",comp.graphics

"Message-ID: <0fpiZBG00WC70qOKYw@andrew.cmu.edu> NNTP-Posting-Host: andrew.cmu.edu   I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret, and some things that i think it implies. (Of course these could all be wrong.....)   from                        THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                Dorothy Denning                            Revised, April 21, 1993  . . .  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called ""Skipjack.""  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  . . .  ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  ------------------  suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field     E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder.  Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not), If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the other party.  If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too.  Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system.  Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some ""panel of experts"" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.  So, am I wrong? Or are these problems.  jon  ",sci.crypt

Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.  >If they were alive today the one opinion we could count upon these men to >express is that a careful study of the mechanisms of government is necessary >and that an ongoing improvement of the same is required.

Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition.

Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President.          Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is ""in principle"" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in?  >|>       I disagree.

These decisions are pushed up to the next higher level >instead.         Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to ""attack"" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want.  With national ""interest groups"" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less  ""contributions"" to make.          Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions.        Local government has not ""failed"" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower.        I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime?        The more people want the more Congress will take power to ""sell"" it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of ""special interests"" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.  >|>       Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than >|>enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its >|>original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy. > >If they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current  >""no state subsidy motto"" they would be better placed. As it is there is >plenty of state money being handed out. The problem is that it is >distributed on the basis of power in congress and not on the basis of >actual need.          Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness.  >In order to set up a school project in New York state you have to pay off the >other 49 states with pork - defense contracts, agricultural subsidies etc. >Or to be precise 30 of the states since you need 60 to beat the filibuster.         Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the ""pork"" in that state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.         The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must ""buy off"" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.  >|>       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing, >|>but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically >|>wanted to avoid.

But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself  that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced.  >The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility >to come to a decision.          The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing.  >Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't >work unless the lower levels are less corrupt. In most cases they are worse, >not better.         The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for.         And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents.         I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt.    >|>       I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were >|>placed on the veto.

Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them, I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House.  >The  >US constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work. The >only part where a reason is given is the right to bear arms ammendment where  >the well regulated militia justification is ambiguous.         The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)  >That the veto was meant to be an exceptional measure follows from the  >fact of the senate. If the President was meant to revise legislation then >there would be three chambers of the legislature, not two. Furthermore >the separation of powers would have been much less distinct.          To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse.  >|>       There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power >|>regarding what a bill is for.

No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about.

Opinion polls show that most people belive the Bill of Rights to grant too much freedom to people, when it is not identified as such (BTW, if anyone knows of a cite for that, I'd love to have it).  Not only does this mean that these people are  willing to give up everyone (else's) rights, they don't even know what  the Bill of Rights actually says.  How can we show the average person (not the average USENET reader) that people are actually entitiled to these rights?  So many people don't care if the government is taking more and more control of us all, a little  at a time.    If there was some sort of awareness of what the government is trying to do by a majority of the US population... Just think about what could be accomplished - but there are so many that trust, unthinkingly, in whatever the media and government tell them. ",sci.crypt

This changes the whole argument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all of its own peds cannot be called homosexual.  Peds are peds who may have a preference as to the sex of the child they molest (though most do not have a preference) but that is a subset of their basic ped nature.  Cramer has as much as admitted that peds and gay men are different orientations.

" Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a boat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known.    Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron Danon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click the mouse.  Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values.  This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process, scanner errors and what have you.  The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so ""global"" adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.  So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of points   Reference(x,y) (the known true values)  DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)  DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)  what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors.  I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a ""bumpy"" 3d surface, solving for the surface and then ""flattening"" it to remove the errors in the other data points.  Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet, pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?  Thanks,  Earl   ",comp.graphics

There is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to ground.  The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver.

WHAT??!!!!  You can't remove it, unless you register?   You gotta be joking, right? What happens if I get a demo-version of that program, install it, and then decide that I don't like it.  Do I have to register to be able to get rid of it?  (Hell, no, that is the last thing I would think of!) If that is what you mean, then you would better make pretty sure, that a statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package!   A better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (IMHO) to allow anyone to install the program, but if they register, they get some additional features enabled.  It could mean only one new .EXE file needed to be copied, to have got the full-version of the program. Of course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever time they like.  Still, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .EXE file around.  That could be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.   As for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions: Limit the size of data that the program can work with, Disable saving the data, Print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as such) Let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started and/or exited  etc.... but DON'T have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it.    -- einari@rhi.hi.is ",sci.electronics

[ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications as a self-styled ""expert"", in fact, when I read about anybody using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder ... ;-) ]  Yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the  correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be  prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine  type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect  conclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent and driver-related stuff.

Call Pre-Owned Electronics, Shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price on a IIci ROM.  Everything has a price.  If you happen to find somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might get a decent price.  There is probably a market for used mother- boards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway.  >Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would >be a reasonably price to offer?  Ask for a quote and then try offering less?  Pre-Owned and Shreve have been known to dicker.  Their ads in various trade magazines often list considerably different prices for the  same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.

" Now the bike is off warranty, I finally replaced the stock items on my Softail Custom with the title ones.

Once installed, I have found easier starting, smoother idle, and more power, plus a more satisfying (to me) bass note in the exhaust register...a lovely whompa-whompa-whompa idle  :-) The folks at MC Ignitions were great in answering my dumb questions on the phone..... a very helpful bunch of guys with a great product.  S&S Super E Carb: installation easy, once I hacked down an Allen wrench to a small anough reach to get at the intake manifold bolts. Tunes like a dream, just like they say!  The stock carb (non-adjustable) was so lean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes, and even backfiring into the intake manifold. The Super E is terrific, no hesitation in any gear, and my plugs are a lovely tan color with no need to rejet from the factory settings!  I know this may not seem like much to you grizzled veteran wrenchers out there, but I had my bike in so many pieces this weekend I began to get worried.

Certainly they *can*, as the example of John in utero proves. I find the translation of Col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ, which the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christ's cricumcision which we, in union with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh.  Also, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism, which can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising with Christ by faith. Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has the advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their baptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless.  Like the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add to their baptism faith and obedience.  Baptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the basis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of God. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy.   > >Romans 10:16-17 ""But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.

While this psalm is figurative in it's language, it is not hyperbolic, and the one does not necessarily imply the other. There is not other hyperbolic language in this psalm. What v 5 is likely refering to is  what is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws (which make intercourse and childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God). The whole psalm is in the language of OT ritual (hyssop, cleansing, burnt offering, etc) David's sin with bathsheba included this element, as he did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have.   But what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was  passed generationally. That's why the organ of generation had to be cut. That's why brith was unclean. Uncleanness was death, and all babies were born dead, and needed to be washed to newness of life, which we have in baptism today.  paul duggan ",soc.religion.christian

Dear Tim:  You say that you were a ""catholic,"" but if you do not believe in the Christian God (I suppose that means the God of the Bible) and publicly state this,    you are in all probability not a Roman Catholic.  ""Public heretics, even those who err in good faith (material heretics), do not belong to the body of the Church"" (Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, 1960, Ludwig Ott, p. 311).  All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to the Church by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judge the condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul  1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians.  Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider    returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.    Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic, that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,    n. 16) teaches: ""Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.""    Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes of God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.  Scripture is one of the best sources for learning what can be known about God.    Stick with the best. --  boundary, the catechist   no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no he venido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, tr. esp.

" You have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in Windows than in DOS - regardless of what communication software you are using.  Try the following:    1) Turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to.  The        cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine        it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.     2) Use a different UART for your serial line.  The old UART's (8250 or 16450)        can only buffer one character internally.  The new UART's (16550) can        buffer 16, which should be plenty for most situations.

The concepts of ""right"" #and ""wrong"" (or ""correct/incorrect"" or ""true/false"") belong to the #domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.

But it makes little #sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is #strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can #certainly ask that question about motives. # #Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered: #they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.

But that is #irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that #one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make #value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the ""correctness"" #of the position.  You can never say that the thing is @really better@, or ""more likely to better, from all realistic frames of reference""?  # #Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is #that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, #neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold #different moral values (feelings).

The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  You can use any old vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a Mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two machines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.      NOW, the special interest disclaimer.  The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400 resolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my 1604s).  THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would advocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.     APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN CONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU TO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND THEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.  personal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers doesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the sync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits (*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a specialized application video card).(i.e. ""well you can get a resolution 1168x832 on this $5,  9"" ""super smelly sock"" monitor that will let you display TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably priced ""oder eater"" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an ultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz vertical."")    Note:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as possible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an inch.                                                                      -A. ",comp.sys.mac.hardware

[*]  Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).  I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:  1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the ""jaggies.""  I'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed, thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?  2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape?  Currently I take:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64  and produce:                           1  2  3  4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12             53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                         57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                     61 62 63 64  Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed?  Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.  [*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points. This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to change size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing.  Hopefully the ""context"" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.

" I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have some comments to share.  The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said ""It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now."" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!  Michal  ",rec.autos

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of  the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi  to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]    The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain  etymology. It may originally have meant ""member of the tribe,"" as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish (""hostile to a member of the tribe""). This meaning would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to ""member of the priestly tribe"" and perhaps to ""priest"" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the ""Magoi"" as one of the six tribes of the Medes.   For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period (Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.   The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.   There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, ""gift""), is not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found, in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separation of the ""mixture"" of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as ""chorus,"" from the root mangh, which is said to mean ""sing the magic song"" (Nyberg, 1966) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for ""priest,"" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is  perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis  (Gershevitch, 1964).   The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in particular derives from an older form, magupati (""head of the Magi""). During the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (""the high priest of high priests"") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.   The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it. The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples of Central Asia.   The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful, or ""Ahrimanical,"" animals (khrafstra) such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants, tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was that of the priesthood: white.   In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the ""magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes"" and thus the ""cult of the gods."" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself.   During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation - the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media, in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.   No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek, like ""goes,"" ""expert in the magic arts"" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.   To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.   The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name.   Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, ""the law-abjuring daivas""), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.; Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own priesthood, would be very strange.   The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (""beneficent spirit"") and Angra Mainyu (""hostile spirit"") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]   Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).   Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]   The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce, 1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.  SAOSHYANT:   The Avestan term saoshyant (""future benefactor""; MPers., soshans) designates the savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind. The concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro- astrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas. Zarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao- shyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present state of the world, when existence will be ""rehabilitated"" and ""made splendid."" [See Frashokereti]   Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological myth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors are born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in Lake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran), protected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited Saoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (""he who embodies truth""), the son of the Vispataurvairi (""she who conquers all""), is the third, who will make existence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will no longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted unlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will be immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the powerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and of asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and render it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with the forces of evil, which will be destroyed.   The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation (Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, ""he who makes truth grow,"" and Ukhshyatnemah, ""he who makes reverence grow""; the names of the three virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra when they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally speculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a millennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.   The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid period (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element in the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining factor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the confines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha, Maitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace its roots to the same source. ",talk.religion.misc

From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip  system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key  management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system  unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in  their data base?  This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key  algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without  court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on  their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways possible.

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu     Ok, let me see if I can get all this out concisely.  I am on an information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of Christianity/churches there are.           My husband and I come from very different, but completely Christian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a born and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot of what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical based Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based. However over the last year, I've been regretting changing to the Church of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are socio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine. One of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through Mary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but in the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I am told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser member, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that verse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men (ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw was when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college groups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the study. Also my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church feels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REAL Christian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call themselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service to long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We are also don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new ""movement"" being led by the young people.  So, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonably biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter what their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women). Christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious convictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still bring their Bibles to service.  We are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and without reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd be thrilled! I'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and even harder for me to stay churchless for long.  any responses would be welcome   the diel family  [I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find what you're looking for.  However the issue is probably more one of the flavor of the specific local churches in your area than the denomination -- Baptists cover quite a spectrum.  Adult baptism sort of narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum. Historically that's been associated with movements that have the character you're trying to avoid.  --clh] ",soc.religion.christian

Speak directly.  If the Lord has given you something to say, say it. But, before I declare ""thus sayeth the Lord"", I'd better know for certain without a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual condition and relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely certain, again, without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers.  Mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous.  For me, my greatest fears in this area would be the following:  1--that the people would be misled 2--that people would lose respect for christianity 3--that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies 4--were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word,    my calling would be lost forever.  God's Word would command the people    never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet.  My    bridges would be burnt forever.  Perhaps I could repent and be saved, but    I could never again be a prophet of God.  In the light of this, it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speak and that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive the world of God's Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate, cowardly silence or by our false statements.  And because of this, it is critically important that we remain close to the Lord, in His Word, and in prayer, and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference.  In this day and age, sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging one another, claiming ""rights"" that are not theirs, denying rights that do indeed belong to others, demanding equal respect for all the ""gods"" of this world, and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel good.

How would a pitch clock work on throws to first?  Maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make, and award a balk if he exceeds it.

It may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the  pitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner, so he may hurry too much.  I'd rather see runs scored as the result of  sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness that could result from this kind of rule.  So, I suppose there are some disadvantages to that idea too.  >|> Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours >|> in the AL.  That's just too damn long.

I remember in little league, if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter's box, even for a moment, we were automatically out.

Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2 mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways, however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this. The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of sinus surgery, though.  About asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, ""Sinus Survival"", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage (postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated - not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.  Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery, as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu   	Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a curve? 	I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we ""graded"" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account? 	I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.  						-Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like ""even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.""  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and ""Holy Tradition"" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.  --clh] ",soc.religion.christian

Denounce GCA '68 as wrong because it's WRONG, not because it's based off of a law from someone else's government.      As for the 'Lots Of Brave Men Died Fighting Nazi's, So Their Laws Have No Place On Our Books!'  Well, lots of brave men died fighting England.  Wanna bet we've got lots of English laws on our books?  Oh, but they're our ALLIES now, so everything's hunky-dory.  I'm *VERY* sure that the GCA is not the only law that we have on the books which is similar, or even based on, a law on the german books.  HOWEVER, that does not give invalidation in and of itself.      WE, THE PEOPLE, must state that we find the law unappealing and contrary to our freedom.  We must use logic, and reason, and compelling arguments.  To use emotion, and appeal to fear is to lower yourselves to the level of your enemies.      A side issue...  When talking about the Amendments, it bothers me to see people acting as if they empower them, but require no responsibility from them.  Free speech also assumes restraint, well armed militia expects well TRAINED militia, the right to vote expects the citizen to try to become educated enough to make a reasonable decision.  You are not granted these rights without any responsibility to the society that offers them.  You have a responsibility in return, and it's to do more than bitch.                                                       --  Morgan Schweers --  Hacker, Furry, SFFan, gamer, writer, MUDder, climber.  24 hours isn't enough! mrs@netcom.com   | Finger mrs@netcom.com or mrs@mcafee.com for my PGP 2.1 key!| New chrome grass! \ B1 S4 a b g j++! k l? p r- s t+ u v- w+ x y- z, approx.__/ Low-level D&D monsters practicing war games @ night.

Well, I don't think your query was exactly polite, but I will TRY to give you a polite responce.  Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.         Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many of the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective       is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that Mr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this ascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a  descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have used it in the past.         The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don't feel compelled to discuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would not have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would not have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call to make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.          I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than me using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have been happier if I had used 'African-american' ?  If so, then you really are lost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting one persons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my  message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.

Also the Mets (my other least  favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.  Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and Lankford and Zeile's off year).

I believe the Cardinal pitching  staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the difference.

So .. ?  So nothing.  It may work for some, but not for others: it doesn't give any insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be dependent solely on the individual, as well as individually-created.

Well, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there was a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago, then there is a supernatural diety who wants us to live a certain way.

The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily documented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible, and that is totally circular.

Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge.  If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my enkephalins go up, then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will ""feel"" right, and I will trust without knowing).

Nobuya ""Higgy"" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):   > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's  > behavior?  It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of Sodom (Genesis 18), Abraham says:   + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.  + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?  + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!  + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as   + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!  There are those who say that the definition of ""good"" is ""whatever God happens to want."" But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you don't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.  Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result.  When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity.  (Origen said: ""Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature."")  Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: ""Good move! Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if I were playing."" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, ""Now, what do suppose induced him to do that?"" or even, ""Boy, that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away!"" Similarly, if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.  One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought.  With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: ""Do not worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.""  I once heard a rabbi speak on this text. He said:          The history of the Jews is largely a history of events    that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued    survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,    amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews    and of Judaism.         The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup    of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of    the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out    of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if    they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have    intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into    their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few    generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a    disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into    the Promised Land.         Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered    sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,    destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of    the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would    be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.    Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of    assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the    worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility    cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human    sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never    again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.    Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the    Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.         Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming    simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only    prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem    every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,    with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place    of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the    Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in    danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,    that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the    controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish    people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge    of all humans everywhere.         Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by    that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather    the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined    to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and    the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might    think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.    The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah    portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage    from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss    that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of    Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)    were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it    had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would    probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism    saved them.          [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]          Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became    famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR    LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,    everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on    stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the    studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast    Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she    later realized that if she had played the screen role, she    would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.    It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney    offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for    it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking    at Walt Disney, she said, ""And now, my special thanks to the    man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!"" It was the most    memorable line of the evening.         In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in    the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive    to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing    with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus    Epiphanes....  After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, ""You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't you?"" He answered, ""If that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it."" I assume that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no state of Israel.  Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about.  I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: ""How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art."" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people, but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid).  Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's plans by behaving justly and courageously.  What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, ""I will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go""? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something like this: ""If you see that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.""  To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are instruments of God's will?      First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.   Yours,  James Kiefer ",soc.religion.christian

A big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider (active) homosexuality a sin.  I don't often see the attitude of ""forgive me and I will try to change"".  Instead I see ""there's nothing wrong with my life and I can be a good Christian, so it must be you who have an illness because you don't accept me"".  Christians can and will accept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner.  Sure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but it is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin!  I was born with a desire to sin, but I work to prevent myself from sinning.  It's much less common now, but I *still* have urges to lash out in anger.  There also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful desires (or ever!), so it is sad to see people leave the church when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after several years.  --  Darin Johnson djohnson@ucsd.edu     ""Particle Man, Particle Man, doing the things a particle can"" ",soc.religion.christian

What is your proof that they ""did the best they could""?   Unless   they had strong evidence that the children were in IMMEDIATE danger   then ""the best they could"" have done was to SHOW RESTRAINT.    Some of us DID predict this outcome, or at least suggested a   strong possibility of it.  I, for one, said that in the event of   an assault against the building the CHILDREN were the ones in danger   either from the assault itself or from a ""Jonestown"" (my phrase   a week after the seige started) style suicide.  And as I pointed   out then, and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net    who disagreed with me, an adult may freely choose suicide but they   have no right to impose this choice on their children.    Now, while I don't expect the FBI to pay any attention to what I    have to say on this, I *DO* expect them to figure it out on their   own or to take the advice of experts.  The cult specialist inter-   viewed in yesterday's Boston Globe said he was repeatedly ""stonewalled""   by the FBI when he pointed out to them that their confrontational   tactics played perfectly into Koresh's mad view of the world and so    increased the chance of a tragic outcome.  >Some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were >done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound - give >me a break.    Give *US* a break!   Pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound    filled with CHILDREN?!!   This doesn't seem to show much regard for    their lives or safety.   ""Nontoxic teargas"" is an oxymoron.  Children   have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions   induced by teargas; moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone   subject to laryngospasms, asthma, or heart disease.    If a madman is holding a gun to a hostage, someone who provokes the    madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the   death of the hostage as the madman himself.  These kinds of situations   have to be handled *delicately* - not by surrounding a place with   tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud-   speakers at all hours.   That approach is idiotic.     >Be part of the solution - not the problem.    The solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the ""the authorities"".   The Feds showed themselves here, as they have so many times in the   past, to be a gang of trigger-happy, impulsive, yahoos who cause more   trouble than they prevent.    Their confrontational approach reinforced   every single message Koresh was giving his followers, virtually guarantee-   ing that whatever crazy solution Koresh proposed would be followed   willingly.

[emphasis added by me] 	Investigators will re-create conditions at the compound and identify accelerants and other fac- tors fueling the inferno.  That is their strong suit. 	But the public must question why agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper- ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve the 51-day standoff free of flames and fury. 	The loss of life most clearly reflects the demen- tia of cult leader David Koresh, whose personal delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious- ness.  His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of arms--and had used them.  LIttle in the way of rationality could be expected from Koresh, a self- confsesed ""sinner without equal."" 	What continues to mystify are th eactions of federal agents, who bungled the case from the start.  The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when 100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To- bacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent on seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap- ons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem- bers died inteh ensuing gun battle.  Earlier oppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside the complex had not been adequately explored. 	Authorities prepared a siege and resolved that those deaths would be the last.  Fifty-one days into  the siege there was no public outcry to storm the compound. 	It had been correctly perceived that the chil- dren inside ""Rancho Apocalypse"" were essentially  hostages.  With their lives at stake, there was no reason for the government to be impatient.  The government's superior firepower, control of water and utilities and freedom of movement created the conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution. 	Neither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the FBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for abandondoning the course of patience. 	If intelligence was accurate and Koresh was growing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi- cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an M-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re- ports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they would have to be weighted against the potential for eve ngreated hamr.   etc etc tec.... [paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted]  But some of the responsibility rests with Clinton, and inexperienced president who did not pay enough attention to the life-and -death decisions being made on WAco. 	If Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en- forcement officers--a common problem among prosecutors. 	Full investigations into th eWaco tragedy must be conducted by both the executive and legislative branches.  The first step is to verify how the blaze  started.  Though apportioning blame will play a  role, it is of greater importnace to find strategies to elude the fire next time.  [end of editorial] -J. Case Kim kim39@husc.harvard.edu  ",talk.politics.guns

"         I am having something very unusual happen.  First  some background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive,  and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on  it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician  Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it,  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad  sectors a week.           Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with  an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program  and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining  for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time.           I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the  exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the  same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went  to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough  there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG,  but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors,  either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the  cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.           Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix  them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are  no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them  for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through  the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.           Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in  about every 100 files are affected.             I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s  system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about  smartdrv to help me out.  --                     INTERNET:  jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver) UUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriver NetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115 ",comp.os.ms-windows.misc

Not so; I can prove that the existance of God is disputable by showing that people dispute it; This is easy: I dispute that God exists. Simple.  I missed your ""Traditional Proofs"" treatise, but the proofs I remember from the Summa Theologic (the 5 ways I think it was) were rather poor stuff. The Ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.  I would think you'd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general failure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones I know of. (I am thinking of the Ontological Argument, the Cosmological Argument and the Teleological argument. Those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names, anyway.)  >Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, >I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen >condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  This is the real question. So to discuss it, I'll assume God exists. Otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.  >Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, >the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the >Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order >to the universe (logos).  Please show this is the case. I am familiar with the First Cause argument, and I'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there is a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices questionable. The rest you'll have to show. This includes that the First Cause is God.  >I next assert that God is all good.  Got it. I deny that God is all good.

This isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship, then God (incarnate or not) can't do it. Well, unless you think God is human. Granted, God made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating: The intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused. God fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.  >Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim >is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  Why?  Also, why assume said claim is true anyway?

You seem to imply this about God, and that the Marines are similar in this respect.. If this is not what you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying, as I have missed it.  >  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will >reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, >and thus must be followed blindly.  Why? Why not question it? Even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? Perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong.  You assert that God is Truth and we can't question Truth. But I assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth. How is it my assertion is less good than yours?  >  One may NOT deny the truth.  Oh?  I hereby deny 1+1=2.  I hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.  Granted, I look pretty damn silly saying something like that, but I needed something we'd both agree was clearly true.

At least, the ones Newton derived are not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances. We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always works in all cases. If we did, Physics would be over already.  Science is all about Questioning this sort of truth. If we didn't, we'd still follow Aristotle. I'd generalize this a little more: If you want to learn anything new, you MUST question the things you Know (tm). Because you can always be wrong.  >Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.  Even presupposing that Truth may not be Denied, and may not be Questioned, and that God is Truth, it only follows that God may not be Denied or Questioned. NOT that he must be obeyed!  We could unquestioningly DISobey him. How annoying of us.

Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL?  Standby-drain specs for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down to zero or all the way up to Vcc.  TTL isn't good at doing the former and it won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors.

Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not ""cease to exist.""  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies ""separation.""  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my ""girlfriend"" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.    >> did you know that Jesus talked more >> about hell than He did about heaven!    >Thank you for this info.

When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.    >Being Jesus was allegedly God, I doubt he could honestly feel >     the pinpricks man dealt him...  This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the ""pinpricks"" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  ""The Consciousness of Christ.""  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He ""grew in knowledge.""  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was ""led of the Spirit"" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.  >Thanks again for the info.  Just so you know, some friends and I >     are starting a Freethinkers organization-- and I'm going to >     use some of the info you provided for an organization intro- >     duction... :-)  I was once a member of that club.  THe ""free thinker"" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his ""rational doubt"" when in fact he was led to it by his ""faith"".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a ""free thinker"" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that ""sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.""  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term ""a""-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out ""Look, your fly is undone!""  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.  >  I tell you what-- if God condemns me for being honest, He is >    unworthy of my worship.  Better to burn in Hell than to >     serve a tyrant in Heaven..  Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first ""Highlander"" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.  --Rex ",soc.religion.christian

I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at different x/y values, the ""ridges"" are out of phase, resulting in the stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap.   Example:   Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)       Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)  Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing. Bravo!

"Message-ID: <1r2pm7$44k@tierra.santafe.ede> NNTP-Posting-Host: sfi.santafe.ede X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]   Several weeks ago, I described a problem with my Apple High-Resolution monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. To recapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor momentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an eighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right after I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that radically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens with no provocation whatsoever.  I have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was a man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the problem was that the 13"" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always keep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's power supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was really wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that it had to be endured.)  This seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to adopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13"" monitor owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the  Apple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading Jitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement of a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that, the swap of a circuit board.  I would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had experience with this sort of thing.  ",comp.sys.mac.hardware

It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not actually using the Valentine-1.  I'd like to give some feedback based on real life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes sense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different directions.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.  I have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I passed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection. But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there was another trap.  And there was!  On other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from a true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator changes.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the  place.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector that leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the car passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar trap when there was none.  I've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features to be useful and not gimmicks.                                         -Barry --  -----                                                                   -------- Barry Frishberg                                             blf@apollo.ch.hp.com Chelmsford-UK Expert Center                                      508/TN 436-4319 Chelmsford, MA                                                  ",rec.autos

A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.

It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

In case I have to remind you the difference,  the majority of the attacks of the Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.  They even tried to justify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the army at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.     In addition, they    massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing    to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their    very lives.

If neither of these is possible, then you'll have to build a sync separator.  Look at the circuit diagrams of your existing sync generators - they probably all include circuitry that does what you want.  	Dave ",sci.electronics

If >that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything >on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify >or refute this?  You are correct (several times). TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard, shared between the NATO governments, to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the  standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect  that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be  exploited. It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic  field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons.  Among other things, I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card, the RS232 parallel cable and the  printer head. The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the  crudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some  intelligence to measuring emission levels, I would find many other potential  sources of leaked information.  Where cryptography is used for serious purposes, poor TEMPEST protection  becomes an important security hazard.  In the early eighties, the need to allow some commercial concerns,  particularly financial institutions, a level of protection against TEMPEST  threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the  'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release'  for while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to  approved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified. If you think about it, it would really have to wouldn't it?      --                                  -= Owen Lewis =-                                       @       Tele/fax  +44-(0)794-301731   ELOKA   Consultancy & Project Management                             oml@eloka.demon.co.uk                         pgp 2.x public key on request ",sci.crypt

" Hello all,  You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-) This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.  Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with serials/paral/floppies and  	- IDE controller ""clone"" Gw2760-EX 		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-(  	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3"" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).  Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price): 	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages 		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt) 	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies. 		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170, 		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)  Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks  simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be  a nice bonus but is not expected.  Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al. Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.  I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone, or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE,  depending on setup/jumpers.  Useful suggestions might be: - How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st). - Do I need some driver to make it work? - --- "" --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards? - do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not  rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred. - adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change a chip or put a jumper!  Also useful: - BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital. - ftp archives with relevant info. - expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while) - any hints into inner workings of the system ...  - anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )  Direct or posted replies are ok.

Yes, BD apologists.  There have been a number of posts defending the BD's as some persecuted religous minority, which is sheer bunk. Maybe the press and certain spokespeople bandied about the term ""cult"", etc., but that is peripheral to the reasons for the initial assault and standoff. It was a weapons raid.  The feds couldn't give a hoot about the BD's  religion, but any group that ILLEGALLY obtains and stockpiles automatic  weapons is a threat.  This goes for neo-Nazis and other non-religous groups. 	So I have this question: If your religious group isn't stockpiling automatic weapons or engaged in some other illegal activity, why is this event a blow to religious freedom?   -Mike  P.S.

" Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to:  In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!""  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands ""quieter"" than others?  ============================================================================== Randy T.

Two things to watch for: In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the phone can be set to pulse dialing. In Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits are pushed ""down"" by one position; this makes dialing (and in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.

"                       THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH        (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions, the military arm of Hamas, an Islamic Palestinian group. Hamas figures significantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which obtained and translated the tape.)        My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished high school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have two daughters.      The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli] Security Services.      Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation, cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into collaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally, we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.      We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70 percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an Israeli soldier.      There's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. I regard the ""isqat"" [the process by which a Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious duty to execute him.      A third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.      In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt, then he is executed.      In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty. But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession.      At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the information we need.      We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply pressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts confess as well.      Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working for the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the information to us. In addition, three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes.       A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of names, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not mark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for execution.      When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators are strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, ""What do you think? How should we execute you?"" One collaborator told us, ""Strangle me."" He hated the sight of blood.  ----- Naftaly Stramer 			 | Intergraph Electronics Internet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A     Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301 ""Quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can.""

It is clear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim that BD members had started the fire.  >    BD's were not contemplating suecide, and there is no reason  >    to believe they committed one.  No reason?  How about these two:  1.  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along the 	corridors and set fire to it.  The speed at which the fire spread 	is not inconsistent with this claim.  2.  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound. 	There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start this 	fire.  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did.  3.  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide, it is very possible that 	David Koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that this 	was not suicide.  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.  There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction:  A.  They are not dead, but escaped via bunker,etc.  From reports of the 	inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found, I would rate this 	as highly unlikely.  B.  The fire was started by an FBI accident.  This is possible, but it would be 	foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it. 	Sure, it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern 	which started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle of 	the day near the edge of the complex?).  It's anecdotal evidence that 	has been contradicted by other escapees.  C.  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI.  This has been suggested by 	some on the NET, and I would rate this possibility as utterly 	ludicrous.  This is what we in ""sci.skeptic"" would call an 	""extraordinary claim"" and won't bother refuting unless someone gives 	any good evidence to back it up.  So we are left with two reasonable possibilities.  That the fire was an FBI accident and that the fire was started by the BD.  I find the latter more likely based on the evidence I've seen so far. --  *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)	*       ___ *					* _____/_o_\_____ *	Twinkle, twinkle, little .sig,	*(==(/_______\)==) *	Keep it less than 5 lines big.	* \==\/     \/==/ ",talk.politics.misc

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection  incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest  that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial  because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and  mortality(mumps, measles. etc.).  > -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick? > How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses  mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response( new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline  with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high. Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression  but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.  > -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long > term effects?  Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good  bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects  of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the  medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects  of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).   > -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than > normal, and what does one do about it?  Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my  opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is  normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many  infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some  physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection  frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to  result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the  length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms  associated with the infection.  > -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?  There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong  immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C,  vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this  is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low  and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune  response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are  distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of  these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe  infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A  status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for  vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five  nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the  others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far. But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the  critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also  be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a  nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone( like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition. Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's  what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves  nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training  needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.

"Approved: gun-control@cs.umd.edu  [MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]  I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws. I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g.  1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get    a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I    was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will    be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.    The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.      Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess    them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will    not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some     manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.    (God knows how much they'll charge for these)  This covers most of what we discussed.

I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on Ephesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when  read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of  justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring the believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word).  Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being  ""justified"" or ""proven"" by the display of good works. Also according  to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a ""dead"" or  ""useless"" faith which fails to save.  James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward  salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

Well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting all your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a  resistor to a common output.  The resistors give some isolation so the signal sources aren't driving directly into each other.   Taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, I'd say that if you are mixing high-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups, etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so.  If you are mixing line-level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman, or such, I'd go with 1K.  input 1 --/\/\/\/ -------------+--- output                                | input 2 --/\/\/\/\-------------+                                | input 3 --/\/\/\/\-------------+   -- paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ ..........   .. . .  . . . university of nebraska - lincoln .  . . .. . .  .. . . . . . . .  .     .    .  .   .     .   .  .    .   .  .   .    .   .  grace .   .    .  .     .         .       .      .        .        .      .        .   happens .

THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS) and Orbiter Duration.     In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy thing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle, for a given orbital change.    From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.  Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess, that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,  and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.  or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit. The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing, and longer drag life.  |> and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables |> so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the |> array tilt motors,  and god knows what else  is going to wear out | |From what I've heard, the motors are fine - it is one of the two  |sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix.

In short, the new technology can:  1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.  It cannot:  1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations.  2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who handle them, etc.  3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication.  > Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government >      agencies to listen in on phone conversations?  > A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with >      no new authorities to access the content of the private >      conversations of Americans.

Unless your friend knows something and is keeping it secret, he was bullshitting you.  Now, it IS possible that he noted a weakness in the *implementation* of the Kerberos protocol. For instance, using a weak RNG to generate keys might cut down on the keyspace (not for the user keys -- for the other kind who's name I can't remember). However, this is not what was claimed. You are claiming a general weakness in DES, which is not known to exist in the open literature.  Don't get me wrong -- DES is weaker than it should be.

A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24).  In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow, something like: ""In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used  in the window attributes when creating, or else a BadMatch occurs.""  This warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides.  However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual.

Like it or not, Edward, Anwar has a very good, valid point.  Obviously, in presenting it, he (quite legitimately and deliberately) takes a point of view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended, but that is one of the best ways to demonstrate a ""slippery slope"" type of argument, which I believe was his aim.  I very frankly believe that the ADL will be proved innocent in this case.  I doubt there's enough evidence to weigh against them even in a civil court, where preponderance of the evidence, not evidence beyond any reasonable doubt, is the standard for ""winning"" such a case.  That, however, does not prevent me from seeing the merit in Anwar's point.

No, but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to get to a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful. The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a major defining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now, and is the part of both disciplines (as social psychology) that strikes me as most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on the net.  An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of ""social norms"" in action is the ""micro"" sociology of Ervin Goffman.  There are some very good introductory essays (""Deference and Demeanor"" is a classic), as well as accessible books like _Interaction Ritual_.  More difficult and theoretical are some of his later books like _Frame Analysis_.  But even at his most academic, Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavily jargon-laden theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable.  Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims in the setting of their expectations of other people, and others' expectations of them.  This becomes ""systematized"" in a ""socially mandated"" way simply because otherwise we'd have to invent the entire context of interpersonal realtions with every single interaction -- and we engage in social inter- actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day, so that a renego- tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion.

""Muslim"" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact, not all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore, there do (did?) exist in ex-Yugoslavia ""Christian Muslims.""  Tito defined the Muslim  nation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the end of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally: Montenegrins, and Makedonijans.   Nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, ""Muslim"" is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who  differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not  a ""Christo-Slavic"" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it was the ""Atheist Communist"" ideology of Tito.  Before Tito, there was no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia.    The war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  It is a civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns instead of pens.

What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is > the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?  OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:  Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes sense.  Matt 5:17 ""Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.""  Jesus lived under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey God's purposes.  Verse 18 says ""For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.""  The key to this verse IMHO is the last  phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, ""accomplished"" what the  Law was supposed to accomplish.    Verse 19:  ""Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.""  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish  people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.  In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about ""doing away with the Law.""  That was not  Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his  people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your  heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be ""doing  away with the Law"" because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only  God's Law.  In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law  and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon  on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people  understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.  In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the  Law in this way:  [23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore  the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be  justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no  longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith  in Christ Jesus.  I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had  served it's purpose, i.e. ""our tutor to lead us to Christ,"" and now, ""we are no longer under a tutor.""  The law has been ""fulfilled""  as Christ said he would do.  God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the ""last will and testament"" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles.  It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re-expressed in Christianity.   On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and  Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the ""mysteries"" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism  representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8), The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff, Acts 20:7)  OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other alternatives.  Please excuse the long posting.

Since then, no serious Israeli leader (including Shamir) really thinks the the occupied territories worth the trouble. The only question became the question of price and other quantitative detail.

John Fife, visited our church about a week ago (just 4 days after Rev. Spahr--it's been a busy week for our small church!!).  He was asked specifically about the issue of homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the GA meeting next month.  Evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range the gamut from ""outlawing"" homosexuality altogether to ""legalizing"" it completely.  He will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult issue that the church has had to deal with since the Presbyterian church split in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago.  Without question, the issue may split the church again after we've been reunited for all of a dozen years or so.  He is hopeful that it will not and is pushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion issue last year as a solution.  He is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the members of the church ""Agree to Disagree"" on the issue, admitting that both sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit lead them to different conclusions.  It worked last year when the abortion issue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that the GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree with their own view.  -- Cliff Slaughterbeck           |  Dept. of Physics, FM-15       |   It's time for the sermon on the University of Washington      |   Grand Torino!

If we allow disagreement, then some presbyteries and churches are going to ordain people that others will not recognize.  That's a difficult situation in a connectional church.  I could live with it, but I think a lot of people would not be willing to.  Note that the church was not willing to live with this kind of compromise with ordination of women.  The one thing that will definitely prevent a person from becoming a Presbyterian minister is if they indicate that they don't accept ordination of women.  The argument is that we can't have half the church not accepting the leaders of the other half.  Maybe people will decide to live with it in this case when they didn't in the other, but I wonder.  I admit that my own Presbytery submitted an overture to the GA that would have exactly this effect, and we considered the ambiguity better than the current situation.  --clh] ",soc.religion.christian

First, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not sway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?

According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the police and military being the other two.)

It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to  pay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's time for something legal would run about $100.

Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C. resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban  can not be easily side-stepped.  > >To show why the tools argument is the silliest i have ever seen.. take an > >analogy from computer science... almost every computer science major > >can write a ""wordprocessor"" yet we(comp sci majors)  would willingly pay 3   > >to 400 bucks for a professional software like wordperfect... why don't we   > >just all write our own software???......

More likely, you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer and get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad example for your case: How many people do you know with illegal copies of $400 word processors?

Or are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and saltpeter? That's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but it works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction in energy (so a .357 magnum would ""only"" be as deadly as a 9mm) and it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the police (the police are often corruptable, and things are known to disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and reappear on the streets...)  > > If guns were really that simple to make... the Bosnian muslims would > >be very happy people (or is it the case that metalworking tools are > >banned in bosnia???

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was ""a beautiful black queen.""  This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled ""Was Cleopatra Black?""  (The answer to the title is ""no""-- she was greek.)  I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the Mediterranean.  (Also, if what I remember is correct, the ""Black Madonna"" doesn't represent a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe Buehler....?)  In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then there are the Ethiopians....  Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are ""white"" (i.e., of the racist's ""race"").  If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, I don't think that this ""Jesus was white"" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did.  Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group. --  C.

I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.  There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.  I have no experience with the Nanao.  I can never keep the Nanao models  straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of  all models.  --   Standard employer disclaimers apply    --  Keith W.

"  	OK...here is my question.  I want to hook up my PowerBook 160 to a SVGA monitor but I do not want to buy the PowerBook/DOS Companion.  Can anyone tell me the EXACT cable I need to connect them?

Also, make sure that your program can not be run out a debugger.  Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk, just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here, you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph. Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with garbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in some random sector.  Like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the opposite of what you want.  Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can think of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, it requests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk should be encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Once again, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRC checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among other things, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects a change in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the program.  Tell them the program is ""VIRUS SECURE"", and remember, you have helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses.  Feel good.  I hope that I have helped.  Have fun.

This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned that the NHL could expand in Europe.  Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing to play for a team in Europe?  I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level. (I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)  When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:  - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton. - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only. - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.  I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:  - Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french   fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One   players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could   not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.  Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved to London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league (2 years ago?)  I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.  Myself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be  the best way to do it?   Marc ",rec.sport.hockey

" Well, I gotta tell ya,  last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU! It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the Don and Ron it was the an ""off-night"" for the Leafs and the Devils  were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....  IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the credit away from Gilmour).  I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY?  Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet, Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs fare when they are once again ""healthy"" if they are playing this well so far??  Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence, moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc. (BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't  remember him having any as of yet.)  Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto.

For the purposes of a contest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get there.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course, if a low priced system existed, there might be demand...    I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably be the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to 'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...  > Any plan for doing > sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting > money in a big way. >   This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In other words, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support, navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system.  You wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I'd hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch system comes on line.  I guess I'd simplify this to say that 'waste' is a slippery concept.  If your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its not 'wasted' money.

Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.  Hmmm. It actually isn't all that much, is it?

If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon. You might have to abandon the colour, though.  Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base to extract TiO2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur compound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob's your uncle.

"NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu  I got a ET4000/W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday and ran a winmark test on it. The card is a VL-BUS card which can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM.  It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers. The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours. Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.  Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using Hint chipsets.  Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab.

It's not surprising at all, but not because of the reason you give. It's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of money behind this program and it will support it. Thus, most corporations will try to get their piece from the pie by supporting it too. The same good old greed.

We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit, and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.  So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway, and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place.  Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image.   >>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How >>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global >>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and >>>much more complicated.  Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way, jumps off the discussion a bit.  My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.   About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image. XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the mentioned type images.  Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from that.  Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen...   >Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?  It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not designed for that. Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say, person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error.  I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design.  So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.  Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where 'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however, even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.

I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null- modem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems, but you should still check your software!  I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the connector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is a ""DB-25"" but IBM has set an alternative ""standard"" of DB-9.  The primary signals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG). There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE. For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR) signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS) signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest) are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect - a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup. DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the ""connection"" has been established i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh there are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:  Name    DB-9     DB-25  SG       5        7  TD       3        2  RD       2        3 DTR       4       20 DSR       6        6 DCD       1        8 RTS       7        4 CTS       8        5  RI       9       22  Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE to a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232 signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert the CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG, and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft- ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the serial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap- Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The only thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications, one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract ""escape"" codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard- ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair game.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements. But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way, I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support- ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more ""gotcha"" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control, if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not specify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use this one.

The drug, which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone  progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection.  The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is  released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. It is more than 99 percent  effective.  ""This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent  pregnancy,"" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. ""As an injectable,  given once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to  missing a daily dose.""  Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and  clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive  protection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the  injections.  As with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and  risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional  before making a decision to use it.  Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive  studies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies  in other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo  Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive.  The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In  addition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain,  dizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have  acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood  clots in the legs, lungs or eyes.  The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the  drug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.

The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this  potential effect.  Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for  contraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich.,  which will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive  Injection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s.  At that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause  breast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer,  including breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.

""These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious  illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would  otherwise be possible,"" said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. ""The effort  to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and  indeed a hallmark of this administration.""   These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to  approve a drug based on ""surrogate endpoints"" or markers. They apply when the  drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such  endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in  themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified  scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient.   Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval  earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or  prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used.   The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and  effectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established.  The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct  postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate  endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness.   One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a  model of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the  cause of AIDS.   Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that  a drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used  safely only under a restricted distribution plan.   ""The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process  without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight,"" said FDA  commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. ""While drug approval will be accomplished  faster, these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and  effectiveness standards required by law.""

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that  certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can  prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The  degeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of  visual impairment       This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of  the National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose  their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug  treatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million  Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and  100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease  that causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo  surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas.       The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa)  Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye  Institute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas  Yasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge  Yancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an  exclusive license for this research from UCSF.      In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to  assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring  substances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week.  Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their  photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light  exposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic  Factor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing  unwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and  Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments.       Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of  Clinical Research, said, ""BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that  have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age- related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment,  and for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF  could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached  surgically.""       ""Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the  retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases  to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope  that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression  and preserve useful vision throughout life,"" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D.,  Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness.       In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in  conjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for  peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy,  motor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By  itself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral  sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease).       Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a  leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for  the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve  injuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and  Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.

These findings, according to  investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have  serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing  countries.       ""This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and  have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the  importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body  weight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing  countries and affluent nations as well,"" explains principal investigator Dr.  William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid  metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University.       Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the  food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while  simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.   These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra  Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have  coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary  heart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is  virtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name  Tarahumara means ""fleet of foot,"" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on  ""kickball"" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more  while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.      The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas,  and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water,  together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras  also eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains  approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69  percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator  in the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while  low in cholesterol and fat.      The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL,  low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density  lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values  are in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated  cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the  Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although  able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL- cholesterol.       Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria  Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school  building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food  was weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the  investigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food  stipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly,  and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for  cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements  included participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.   Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were  fed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an ""affluent"" diet.       ""In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40  percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that  many Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in  fiber,"" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in  the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian  Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  ""The CSI is a single number that  incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in  the diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol  level, particularly the LDL,"" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet  averages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's ""affluent"" diet used in the study  ranks a CSI of 149.       The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of  establishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before  exposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating  dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or  plateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat  and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  ""You  must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put  into the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not  discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease  because the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on  a plateau,"" Dr. Connor says.       After 5 weeks of consuming the ""affluent"" diet, the subjects' mean plasma  cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL  fraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent,  and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride  levels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in  weight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon,  yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35  days.   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993       The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized  nations.  ""We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount  of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic  study.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary  cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.   In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total  calories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects  the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary  cholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased  quite a bit in this study,"" Dr. Connor explains.      Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of  coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of  fat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because  of their usual high fat intake.       Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20  percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI  around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in  meat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent  suggestions that Americans adopt a ""Mediterranean-style"" diet.  ""The original  Mediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of  fat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of  meat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to  olive oil is not going to help the situation.""       The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the  emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies  undergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart  disease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different  diet than the average citizen.  ""If the pattern of afluence increases, the  entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease,  which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the  developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can  concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public  health measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for  unnecessary, expensive medical technology,"" Dr. Connors says.      ""The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move  their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a  very short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary  heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years  ago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,"" he concludes.

Suppose you had the option to specify that your tax money can't pay for abortions.  Do you think that that should entitle you to pay *less* taxes? Since refusing to fund abortions would lead to an even larger increase in funding for pre-natal care and delivery, if anything you should pay *more* taxes.  Suppose we let your taxes stay at the same level.  Do you really think that funding for abortion would be reduced?  No, your taxes would go towards other things, and more taxes from those who don't object to paying for abortion would be moved from those other things to pay for abortions.  All that happens is that the funds get shuffled around, to give you a clear conscience.  Why put the government through all that paperwork when the end result is no different?  Why worry about it when it makes no difference and it doesn't hurt you in the least.  >Your advice,  >     People should stop worrying about where their individual money is >     going and instead *vote* for how government should spend *all* >     the money it gets.

That is the most rediculous out-of-context analogy I have every heard.  I do not advocate any such ""advice"".  There is quite a difference between the illegal violation called ""rape"", and the constitutionally granted power of taxation along with the funding of legal procedures.  If you can't see the difference you can go to hell.  >Care to respond this time, Mr. Parker?  >The following challenges remain unmet by Mr. Parker.

Your yanking followups to posts of mine (from other threads?) does not demonstrate any deliberate lack of response on my part.  There is a great deal of bandwidth on talk.abortion, and it can take a long time to get through to the followups to articles I have posted, and many times responses expire before I get to reading them.

If you want to hear more about this aspect of ""personity"" go read the thread ""Why is bodily autonomy so important?"" on talk.abortion. You may have to look at all unexpired posts on that thread to find the post where I give a fairly detailed explanation.  I believe it was posted on April 18 or 19.  The second part is a definition of a person.  A simplistic explanation is that a ""person"" is a member of society.  Most normal adult human beings are good examples of ""people"".  Most children over two years old are ""people"" as well.  The simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation with them.  It is actually more complicated than that, but I have no desire to spend the time it would take to explain it to you.

"   ANNOUNCEMENT:	The ""HyperKnowledge"" PROJECT for NeXTSTEP  Motivation  We are a heterogeneous group of scientists and students who feel that our   work is continuously hindered by computer environments dominated by   incompatible scientific tools and monstrous software packages (too often   claiming to do everything).  Rather than being able to use different tools   together in a flexible, interactive system, we find ourselves spending too   much time converting between different data formats, writing throw-away   tools and I/O parsers, and worrying about how to get to a particular goal   rather than what it means to have attained it.  What we need is an object-oriented scientific environment where the tools   we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system,   highly interactive, and extendable (both by the addition of our own   specialized objects and by combining the available tools - graphically).    The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work,   requiring a very short learning phase and practically no   user-documentation.  The user should feel encouraged to explore different   possibilities, testing his/her own scientific ideas without worrying too   much about whether the system is able to cope (within reason, of course).    By building an open and object-oriented system, each user should be able   to draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a   particular task: we all need to organize and archive our data, display   results, and combine information from many different sources.  Currently, the group consists of people from very different fields:   Molecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, and Geography.    While many of our needs for such an environment diverge, the underlying   motivation is the same: no matter what you want to call it, we need a   system which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific   data and daily work.   Why NeXTSTEP?  What else is there?  No other system offers the same power, a totally   object-oriented developers environment, UNIX-compatibility,   highly-interactive and standardized user-interface.  With the advent of   NS486 and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range   of hardware platforms, such a system will soon be nearly universally   available.  Classical workstation vendors (SUN, IBM, HP, and the rest) now   have little to offer, no similar tools exist for the standard X-Windows   GUI, if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware, and the   mass-market Windows/DOS world is a developer's nightmare (either despite,   or more probably because of, OLE).  In order to progress, we need an open discussion of how best to develop   such an environment.  In NeXTSTEP parlance, do we simply have to put   together a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our   ""Hyper-knowledge"" servers? Should be use distributed objects?  What   minimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the   environment?  What tool-needs do we all have in common and which ones are   best developed by specialized sub-groups?  How many already existing tools   can/should be integrated into the system (e.g. Mathematica)?  Do we need   an ""AVS""-like tool for data-flow manipulation?

I use DOS6, with memmaker, have 4MB of internal Memory and a 486DX,  Does anybody knows why this is happening (possibly win needs some UMB's to manage virtual memory?, If true, which UMB's, those that EMM386 can find without including suspicious parts?)

Sounds like you were going to a different Penn State or something. Kampus Krusade for Khrist is very vocal here, but they really have little power to get anything done.  Sometimes it seems like there are a lot of them because they're generally more vocal than their opposition, but there really aren't that many Krusaders.  The liberals tend to keep to themselves if they can help it, since all they really want is to be allowed to go about their own lives the way they want to.  ...so you don't hear from or about most of them.  The bible-bangers stand out because they want everyone to be forced to live according to bible-banger rules.  The Krusaders certainly don't run this place.

" Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is  relevant for med students too.  Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically. Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy,  histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass  memorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most  med students are.  Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I  have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have never applied them to large amounts of ""data"".  Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or cheap software?     Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an older student who returned to school this year, organization (another one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success.  Please no griping about how all you have to do is ""learn"" the material conceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strong  points.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is rote memorization.    Thanks for your help. ",sci.med

The engine >compartment looks really tight to work on, but it is in fine shape and >I am quite interested in it.  That would be the Opel GT, sold in this country from '69 to '73.  It originally had a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based on the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear and a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was limited as a performer.  There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other models.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that were also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer 1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon, and a ""sport coupe"", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there were two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900 engine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also available as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights, but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.  In 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last year for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations and the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing to build the GTs.  The 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the Manta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with Bosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and wider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century low price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.  From 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by the Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them Opels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs.  Various models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the 70's in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.  Parts are still available from a number of sources.

Being ""frightening"" isn't a crime.  Some people are afraid of young Black males.  That doesn't make the mere status of being a young Black male a crime.

Hmmm.  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all?  Are you running any standard MS-Windows programs like Word ?  What sort of  packets go blazing through?

I've had kidney stones 4 times  and I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see  a doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones are extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it out.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she absolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps an over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor. Kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed  to make sure there is not a serious problem.  Steve ",sci.med

"  SPEAKING OF VAT:  Did anyone see CNN's report yesterday (4/15)?  It  was quite hillarious (no pun intended).  They ran down how a percent tax was added at each stage of manufacturing, graphicaly depicting a stack of  quarters being added at each wholesale stage.  When they got to the final  stage (the actual retail sale) the small stack of quarters added to the large stack already there was said to be ""the amount paid by consumers."" In other words, they completed ignored the fact that at each stage the tax would of course be passed on to the next buyer with the retail consumer paying the full load.

Chiu knows the score and is just being silly. However, ""decibel"" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.  Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels, and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel, hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).  The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field. Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers, but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.) All the other units were defined many decades earlier.       --  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ",sci.electronics

If you don't do this, the >cursor will be hard to track when in motion.  You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z. We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned. You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver- tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking, set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough advertising.  I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to X10).  The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused. Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you  do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it's mapped.  As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work. But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.  As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else  than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line of code). I'll put this on export today.

" I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a chance to read the news for a couple of days...  The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned in front of the user's eye.  The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse with the background.  I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key. The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.

" OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime, the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.  First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse).  I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.  I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default ""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames.  I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used for the results I'd been reporting earlier.  Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.  That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.  I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...  Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.  The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with ""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task switching.  A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.  I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more...

"Nntp-Posting-Host: prague.gain.com    Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!   BACKGROUND  ----------   The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions   devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad   interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,   roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,  motosports enthusiasts.   The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little  over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada  Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.   The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need   to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of   performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise   ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.   Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to   issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be ""flame-free"".     HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION  ---------------------------------   You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:           race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day  (depending on the topic).      NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the        list directly.    After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive  an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner  so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in  order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.    Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily  or digest distribution (as per your initial request).   HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION  ----------------------------------   It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a  single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out   whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the  frequency of postings this appears to be about every other  day.   Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every   30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:           digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    HOW TO POST TO THE LIST  -----------------------   This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:           race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may  not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it  (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)  you can include a ""metoo"" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX  based mail systems).    BOUNCES  -------   Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace  the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with  bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,  sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of  employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive  bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and  if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I  administer this list) contact me through my administration  hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce.

"   I have replaced the osz to 66 MHz yesterday and no truble at all. My Quadra now works at 33 MHz stable for more than 14 hours. I have also tried a 70 MHz osz, but after 1/2 hour my Quadra 700 died. I am not sure what was the reason for that, but it is to risky to run it to fast. Most of your Quadras 700 should work at 33 MHz without any problems.   But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade. During my 35 MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again. So once again do a backup befor you start!!!!!!!!!  Now the speedometer results after replacing the osz.

Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board. The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz. The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams. I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o     wn clockspeed so they wont make truble.  The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F). If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F (45 C) and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.

Excellent point, and there's a related point I'd like to make. They'll have to back up these databases themselves, won't they? How many tape copies will there be, and how secure will the tapes be?  If they store them off-site, it wouldn't be too hard to hijack them in transit.

For if they had >had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, ""Neither of them >has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born."" >  Paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the man born blind (John 9) was not.  There is no question here of the simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner of one's destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them, do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.  And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation does not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist, who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to  have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But  it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether  he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in  the first case and very weak in the third.  I would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of Christianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they are Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure. I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth lives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed  in this newsgroup in particular.  I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as an authority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light of these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar- nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later times, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first two millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes  important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our  understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the  significance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I  have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible  to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude* (rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB. So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.  For power:    dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )  For amplitude    dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )  'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base 10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel. It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.  Common references for audio are:  	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms 	0 dBV = 1 volt  	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level) 	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)   Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment.  Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm's law.  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

" Howdy  We have been having a real problem with an AST 386sx/16 machine with 4mb of RAM.  We installed Paradox for Windows, (but I don't think  Paradox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok (windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell network (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), DOS 5, Win 3.1) but the program will not load in 386 enchanted mode.

Two notes of interest from Texas:  The Tarrant Couonty ME (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering judgements that are contrary to the police view.  He presented evidence a few years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had his hands in the air.  This does not bode well for the boys in black.  The Texas Dept. of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for the ATF.  I have heard them referred to as ""those fucking cowboys"".  The DPS was totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as ""traffic cops"".  ATF now has two strikes against them.  Finally (I guess that makes three notes), rumour from Waco is that four ATF agents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of the flashed ""an automatic weapon"" at a cop.  Lots of pissed of cops.

First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try to use plain vanilla DOS.

For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace- ment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will even change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMan does that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt do that, huh? :) )... And the list goes on and on...

On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons not correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :).. PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager... Modify your  settings to have FM as your shell and not PM, or get a couple of utilities from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel'...

"  Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes.   New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at Huntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported  To: National Desk, Health Writer  Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or           800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research           Institutes.     LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing  and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal, Radiology.    Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes.  By comparison, the current ""standard of care"" in testing for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.    In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.    ""We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted with either the MRS or PROBE software,"" said Dr. Ross, adding, ""this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.""    Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.    Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross believes, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.    ""Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate Alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we consider this test a major advancement in medicine,"" said Bruce Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher and a co-author of the study.    Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats, Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley, R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200 General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States, and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.    For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology May issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.     Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:     What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?    Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality, loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.    How many people does it affect?    Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both emotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.    What are its signs and symptoms?    Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe ""forgetfulness"" caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School of Medicine at New York University says ""whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree"" and suggests the following criteria:     -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is       normal.    -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.    -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.    -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.     Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.  -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044 ",sci.med

It has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing budgets that MS do.  4DOS, for instance, is everything that COMMAND.COM should have been (but never could be under MS).  Those who use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine.  But they have to rely on word of mouth for sales.  It seems to have worked pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine.  That's okay, marketing isn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way.  They have a lot more to be proud of than MS does.  If MS really gave a damn, they could duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with compatability issues and absconding with the technology.  DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch marketing and vendor agreements.  The ""mediocre"" was excusable in the early days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years to play with it.  An interesting thought on that: Most MS products that I'm aware of in the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and programmers through easter egg screens, including Windows, or at least have the names buried in the files.  Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0 and 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it? --  There's at least one fool in every married couple. ",comp.os.ms-windows.misc

" I have been using a HDS X-terminal, and really like it. What is really powerful is that it can run the X server without running a window manager. One can then run a special client X program called a window manager, either (1) run  motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook from some home place (like a sparc, or vms).  This is powerful, especially since I can exit one window manager (without killing windows) and then start up another manager. (Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in one manager and not the other).  Well the question is:    On a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to   break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program?

This prediction stuck in my mind because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.

EACH ONE AND HIS OWN NEVO*  (* A reference to General Azri'el Nevo, Shamir's Military Secretary.  Irrelevant to this excerpt.)  By Nahum Barne'a  . . .  In mid '91 SHABAK found itself in the center of another storm [...].  A year and a half earlier, Khaled Sheikh Ali, 27, a member of the Islamic Jihad, died at the SHABAK installation in Gaza prison.  The two SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put on trial. In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and sentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this was the first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to prison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the director of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the effectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case were [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza.  When they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators agreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed in charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the directors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matter of the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture, but also ""the culture of lies"", which Judge Landau had described in his report of two years before, were still very much in existence.  Nothing had changed.  The report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among them the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system and Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not know.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with low ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the explanation.  One of SHABAK's high-ranking officials was transfered from his very high position to a less high position.  . . .  [""The culture of lies"" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators' policy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were tortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission sought to correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods -- thus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those methods were used to extract a confession.  The fact that the need to lie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking to the ""approved"" torture methods. -- Yigal] -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu ",talk.politics.mideast

In expanded muxed mode, you *could* do it. Much easier if you get a DRAM controller IC. The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or you could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh address multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd timing, address multiplexing, and refresh.  Actually, if you wanted to use a 68008 IC, you could look at AN897, which has a neat controller built in.

" Hi Javier, (how are things at Corp, my old stomping ground was c-level?) Vibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least, by warped rotors. When the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure on the rotor.  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec). There could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free. ",rec.autos

"  A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post the following information.  A few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting to fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).   It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.  She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal.    She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should see an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?  ** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm,  coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out.

This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run from a single-ended supply as well).

"   	After reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to add.  	First, most of the people I know who activly use encryption privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate, and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That, after all IS the bottom line.   	Second, if I look at all the people I know who use any form of encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who still insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people  looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves their methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make mistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else.   	Third, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption stratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip. That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can  not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.  	Fourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid people out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the  built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going to run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption.    	If nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However, the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything else. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be slowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to  convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything, the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.   	The bottom line here is that people will use what works, and unavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy. 	The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide  useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is out of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box has been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness to this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger degree.

" There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer.  I don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.  HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no soldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP service center for further information.  The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from the PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser printers.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material difference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously slow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect works, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.  The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as about 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for its internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.  A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer has completed its warm-up cyle.  Until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely. Chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the problem.  Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges, mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste could use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet IV.  Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image drum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice print engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system.  The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper. The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is almost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable, though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician. I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.  It depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted, the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.   --  Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED ",sci.electronics

All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.  >The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to  >fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows >and a few other things.  A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a ""magic"" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in ""chunks"" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it ""fixes"".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:  >C:\GFX\VPIC46\CVPIC.EXE >C:\GFX\VPIC46\VPIC.TXT >C:\GFX\VPIC46\VIDEO7.CFG >C:\GFX\VPIC46\ORCPRO2.CFG >C:\GFX\VPIC46\VGA.CFG >C:\GAME\GOOSE\BIRD2.X >C:\WINMISC\ADV21\WINADV.EXE >   Allocation error, size adjusted  All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))  >   316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains. >    647168 bytes disk space would be freed  Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these ""lost chains"" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked ""available"" in the FAT.   >C:\GFX\VPIC46\CVPIC.EXE >   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133  ...  >C:\386SPART.PAR >   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133  These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will ""fix"" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  ""Missing pieces"" are likely to be found in those ""lost chains"" at the top...)  >  42366976 bytes total disk space >   3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files >    153600 bytes in 67 directories >  36042752 bytes in 1496 user files >   1564672 bytes available on disk  Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.

" Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think it's great!  However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?  Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?  Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.

If, on the other hand, this is not a matter     of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the    Pope is the legal head of the church.     In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice    but to obey.  This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is more or less heresy.  You might call it ""infallibilism"".  It's the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does. This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.  The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.  A couple historical examples come to mind.  Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!  Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages. He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to defining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church. He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church.  If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism.  The teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Pope must be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith. A Pope's authority is given for the purpose of building up the Catholic Church.  Commands in conflict with this purpose have no legal *or* moral force. ",soc.religion.christian

Are you Christian or Pauline?  [Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.  As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies of Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't come up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various Christian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups.  Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that it applies to Gentiles.  And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're looking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.  I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's unfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we do know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus dealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15 more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't see that there's a big problem.  --clh] ",soc.religion.christian

But evidence is evidence - it requires a ""jury"" or a process to sort it out and determine the truth from the junk.  Medicine must continue to strive to better understand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviating illness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle;  it is not worthless.

Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

How could I do this? I don't want it just to turn on, I want it to 'strobe' once so to speak, per every beep I put on a cassette tape.        Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette, or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency? Is there any easy way to do either of these? I'm looking for  the simplest circuit possible. I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of color organ, but not quite. Let me trt to explain again...        I'm going to have a pattern of beats (or beeps) on a cassette tape. So on the tape you'd hear:   beep! (pause) beep! (pause) beep! (pause)..etc.  , with speed increasing as time goes on. I want to synchronize an LED ( probably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape. So the LED, with each beep, would go on and off real quick, generating a strobe light sort of effect. The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the LEDS. And if there was no sound on the tape (except for background his), the LEDs would remain off. Please help!     Thanks,      Dana   ",sci.electronics
"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu   	Often times (most recently on this list in the last few days) I've heard the passage from revelation:  	""...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes 	 words from this book...""      	 used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books.  	 I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons:  	 1.  They weren't added later by the Catholic Church; they were 		*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture. 		(This has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason 		to repeat the info.)  	2.  It is more likely than not that when St. John (or whomever) wrote 		the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was 		** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands!  	If one takes the translation of ""this book"" in REV 18:22 (or somewhere 	around there) to mean ""all of scripture"", then all of us are likely 	holding something that is in violation of this command.  	It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones 	(they didn't like to date their letters, I guess).  I really wish I 	had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but I believe 	that several of the N.T. letters, chief among them 2 Peter, have their 	most likely date of composition in the early second century A.D. 		Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of  	Domition (sp?), A.D. 80-96.  Thus it could be argues that we are all 	in sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture, since it was ""added"" to the 	book after the composition of Revelation, when we are told to add  	nothing more.  	If you want to get the exact dates, get a copy of the New American 	Bible.

Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].  Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to  be a proper reaction [and so does the law].    Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent  since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be more deadly.  --  Michael Phelps, (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..

(I don't know. Haven't used one in 20 years)         Money orders operate pretty much like checks, with both parties being supposed to sign them.  I assume you'd have to show the buy-back people an ID, and you'd then have a money order made out to that ID.           As far as traceable as a practical matter, I don't know, it would depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name is on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.

It is     disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich    or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed     solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.  I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is not terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.     [snip]    imagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like     to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer    in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....  I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are ""terrorist camps"".  There are however some which come very close to serving that purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way prior to the invasion.      SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of    the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not     know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often    suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are    supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and    ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps    for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured    by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages    of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they    are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" where    an 8 year old girl just happened to be.  Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you describe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area, backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation, while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing, which would have produced major casualties.     Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that    we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance    on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING     ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real     leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.  Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent further attacks.     This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to    realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting    its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more    Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel    would have resulted in.    Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no longer civilian and now primarily military though.     There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese    goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such     circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is    capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did    in all other parts of Lebanon.  No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another Lebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.     I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing    CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.  No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.  -- Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers, OS Software Engineer    | Thinking Machines Corp. |	the winged ninjas of the skies.

I'm just trying to find out the >coherence of the societally based morality position.  Is my assumption of >societally based morals wrong?    No, but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to get to a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful. The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a major defining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now, and is the part of both disciplines (as social psychology) that strikes me as most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on the net.  An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of ""social norms"" in action is the ""micro"" sociology of Ervin Goffman.  There are some very good introductory essays (""Deference and Demeanor"" is a classic), as well as accessible books like _Interaction Ritual_.  More difficult and theoretical are some of his later books like _Frame Analysis_.  But even at his most academic, Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavily jargon-laden theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable.  Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims in the setting of their expectations of other people, and others' expectations of them.  This becomes ""systematized"" in a ""socially mandated"" way simply because otherwise we'd have to invent the entire context of interpersonal realtions with every single interaction -- and we engage in social inter- actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day, so that a renego- tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion.

If they have them, I think  people have a right to hear the tapes.   >   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say?  Their credibility >is shot anyway, since they *origianlly* said that Koresh was going to surrender >after the Passover.  We saw how accurate that was.  I don't contend that Koresh wasn't a liar. That's not really the issue. The issue is did the federal agents use the most prudent measures available in ""ending"" this fiasco (that in my opinion was bungled from the very beginning)?  >   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside.  Outside  >meaning outside the compound?  Yes, the FBI reported seeing two people >(according to CNN reports) using torches to set the compound on fire.   They >were outside.

Right now a lot of people on all sides of this issue are making conflicting statements right and left. Some real live evidence would be most welcome!  You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible >for the fire and the ""destruction of the people"".  All you have done is >put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back >up your claim that the FBI was responsible.  In my opinion, it is possible that the actions of the FBI: a) indirectly, b) directly but not intentionally, or c) intentionally (I hope not the latter, but we would be naive to discount this possibility entirely) caused the fire. It is possible that someone inside the community started the fire because they ""thought"" God told them to or because they simply would rather die than surrender. Who knows?   We are left with some compelling questions here, besides the above. Why haven't the droves of news reporters commented on whether or not they heard shots coming from within the compound once the tank (I don't remember its technical name) started ramming down the door? It seems to me that gunshots would be audible at 2.5 to 3 miles away.  Why couldn't the FBI wait until Koresh wrote his manuscript, as they had promised they would. Does the fact that Koresh lied justify the FBI's lying as well?  Will an ""internal investigation"" really reveal what happened, if in fact the BATF and FBI are at least partly to blame?  How will we ever know if Koresh broke the law as was alleged in the now-unsealed (finally!) warrant? Certainly we won't find out in a court of law.  There's been a lot of talk about why the people didn't run out when the fire started, but one survivor said that the tank had collapsed the stairway and entryway and that the majority of the people were trapped. Only those in another part of the house escaped.  People have commented on the unwillingness of the woman who came running out of the house with her clothes ablaze to remain outside rather than going back in. When was the last time you had your clothes on fire? Who  the heck knows if you'd know which way you were running and why? I think the FBI agent who grabbed her and pulled her to safety acted heroically,  btw. I'm certainly not trying to paint a picture of the ""evil feds""  by any means. I simply question the decisions from start to finish that led to the horrible tragedy of yesterday.     >--  >John Mechalas                                          ""I'm not an actor, but >mechalas@gn.ecn.purdue.edu                                 I play one on TV."" >Aero Engineering, Purdue University                     #include disclaimer.h > ",talk.religion.misc

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla, on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.  If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion, that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.                                       -Sean    *******************************************************************************   ""Behind the bag!""             - Vin Scully ******************************************************************************* ",rec.sport.baseball

New experimental processors have 64-bit data pathways and can schedule up to 8 out of 32 instructions each clock cycle.  That sort of trick can't really be done with CISC architectures.  I finally saw some details on the 586/Pentium and was not greatly impressed.  They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to speed, but otherwise it's only going to be a 2x speedup.  And to get that they're using two integer units, larger caches, and a branch target buffer.  Yes, I know they're talking about 100MHz processors. Big whoop.

"  In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap that is going on in the MOA, (which some folks took not as dissemination  of information that I received, but as my own bad mouthing) I thought that I would post this one, which came to me yesterday.  This is from board member Robert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse.  This is NOT my words, O.K. guys?                                     April 4, 1993  re:  Cecil King's Nominating Statement   Dear Chick:       We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the  MOA this year.  Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the Owners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by the by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:  ""Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to a combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.      Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's statement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with the word ""undertiding"" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement of his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does not just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the  process.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.      Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would be most appreciative that when tou call me an ""asshole"" you remind the letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost guaranteed to have woeful consequences.    With kind regards, I remain,                                  Robert Higdon  O.K. MOA'ers, You read it, think for yourself, I trust you do know who Cecil King is, and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass, and he is a pres. candidate.  I let you draw your own conclusions.

" I've had a Valentine for about 9 months now and I agree that it is the best det ector available. The point here is trust and reliability. I've been able to ""tr ust"" the Valentine more than any other detector I've owend. If the Valentine sa ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me, then it's mo re than likely to be a speed trap. With my other detectors, I've gotten so many  falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want t o drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal.  That directional indicator really, really helps. Plus, more info is almost alwa ys better than less info. No matter how smart radar detectors get, the human br ain is usually smarter. So, if I'm going to make a decisio based on information  at hand, I want all the info I can get. Plus, if you divide the overall streng th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported, you'll find that each bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. With other detectors, yo u'll just get one strong warning. My logic may be faulty on this, but I think i t works okay.  Although, I must admit that I haven't really noticed the reflection problem of one radar souce.  Thomas ",rec.autos

(Now remember, you still think the > world is flat).  This is quite an extraordinary claim.  I think C.S. Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the world is flat.  However, this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds and their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in  voluntarly actions. I don't think Plato would have been happy with this, and neither would Paul, although Paul's ideas were quite different. However, if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group, and not just preach, you would see that there currently is much evidence in favour of these statements.  The same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature.

[deletions]  Jim - we essentially agree, except about the definition of ""fact."" The scientific definition of ""fact"" is not ""the ultimate truth,"" but rather ""a theory which is so supported by evidence and so predictive that it is pointless to test it anymore.""  So, we have the fact of evolution and we have theories of evolution (just as we have the fact of gravity and theories of gravity, and the fact of the atomic nature of matter and atomic theory).  The fact of evolution is that the current diversity of life arose through common descent:  this is so supported by the evidence that no one ever bothers to try to test it anymore.  Theories of evolution include theories regarding the mechanism of common descent (natural selection vs. drift) or the actual ""pathways"" of evolution, or any number of other things.  These are constantly being tested, because the actual mechanisms, etc, behind the fact of common descent are still up for question.  Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory.  In other words, it could, theoretically, still be falsified and rejected.  But since it's so predictive, and so consistently supported by evidence, it seems pointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore.

Here is where you fail to make an important distinction.  You have shoehorned the _facts_ of the _existence_ of gravity and atoms and evolution into one category with the _theories_ which have been proposed to explain the _mechanisms_.

"Nntp-Posting-Host: euclid.ucsd.edu    WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi  SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to ""the extermination of the Jewish race""--went on display Friday at the National Archives. 	The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth, archivists say. 	""The notes give them their authenticity,"" said Robert Wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  ""He was supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules."" 	The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria. 	Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  ""I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.""  [Emphasis mine--rje] 	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as ""extermination"" is *Ausrottung*. 	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be ""extirpation"" or ""tearing up by the roots."" 	In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, ""Judenevakuierung"" or ""evacuation of the Jews.""  But archives officials said ""extermination"" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives. 	Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's ""final solution of the Jewish question,"" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945. 	The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26. 	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.  	---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

The x-Soviet   >MY GOSH!!! Sedar, WHAT ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT???  Armenia didn't even become    No wonder you clown are in such a mess. Let's take Sarkis Atamian's (an  Armenian Dashnak sociolog) book, ""The Armenian Community"", pages 97 and  105. Atamian quotes:   ""... the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and  tactics of revolution. The liberation of Armenia, the immediate aim of  the Party, was to be attained by:        1. Oral and written propaganda.       2. Terrorism - both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure          of self defense.        3. The creation of an avant-garde of revolutionary groups to be          equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared          for a general uprising.       4. The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with          each other and subject to a central body.       5. Organization of units of guerilla fighters.""  Now, on page 105, Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution:   ""... If the means was revolution, how was the revolution to be attained?  By:        1. Propaganda        2. Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination       3. Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people       4. The arming of the people       5. Organization of revolutionary committees       6. Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with          the official bodies and journals       7. Organization of financial zones for public collection        8. 'Fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government          officers, spies, traitors, grafters, and all sorts of oppressors       9. Defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry      10. Building of roads for the transport of arms      11. Wrecking and looting of governmental institutions.""  Many of the recent Armenian terrorist acts against the Turkish people  were committed by the brainwashed members of the ""Tzeghagron"", namely,  ""race-worshipers"" of the Dashnag Youth Organization. Ironically, again,  Tzeghagron was set up by an undisputed Armenian Nazi, Karekin Nejdeh, in 1941 (see Atamian, loc cit, page 389).  Serdar Argic                             'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                   (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                            'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                              a single Turkish soul.'

I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, >even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.  I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least, our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the 'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal. I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that, just because it has changed the way we strive.  BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.

But to think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and that these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  These agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have ultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then tell the Prez, who says, ""I knew all along"".  While this may not seem right, or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command leading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, after all, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and maybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure if they should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses are a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority religion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of cults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave. Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are associated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt BATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was unjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said are true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President Clinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives should be ashamed.

" The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries. I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did.  ____________________________________________________________________________ [Reprinted w/o permission]   ""There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries""  By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services        On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings  is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.      It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called  Families USA.       The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe  that doctors make too much money.      The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for  physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be  OK.      How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.      Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment  and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign  and are still simmering.      You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that  earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority  of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who  do are stealing it from them.      Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.   Karl Marx lives.      It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such  as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to  become a physician?      If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should  have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they  should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much  a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a  doctor?      Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  ""How  much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent  grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order  to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking  courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and  maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years  of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth  years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and  (d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e)  put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training,  depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in  debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60  hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or  more until they retire or fall over?""      As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably  more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and  Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have  called together to remake America's health care.      Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far  more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing,  social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is  to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.      But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates,  many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the  major cause of high medical costs.      Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.   Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for  our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in  a McDonald's?      And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become  a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch  cabbages.      Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or  Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But  instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain,  they might have been more honest if they had said:      ""Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest  problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes,  you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you  guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack;  getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the  microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into  the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot  victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease  while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.      ""You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single  biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is  amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.      ""In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at  your blubbery bods all day.      ""So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and  start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy- greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.""      But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid,  there is another solution: Don't use them.      That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those  spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands  upon your head and declare you fit.      Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest  pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit  there, and pop in a couple of valves.      You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that  overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house  than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and  malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?      Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.   And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on  how to give it its shots.      By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much  pollsters should earn?

" I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU  cooler on the chip.  After about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough  to dislodge the CPU from its mount.  It ended up bending a few pins on the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet.  I ended up pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU cooler back on.  So far so good.  Have others had this problem?  How do you ensure that the weight of the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?  --  Will Estes		Internet: westes@netcom.com ",comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

I can't imagine that it would be cheaper  to build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached (and  exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago.   It's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts -  this could cause problems in a Q800.

Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that.

Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, ""hi'ipoi"", the Hawaiian word for ""cherish"" means ""sharing food"".  The Great Mahele, in which the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so- called ""theft"" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which, until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.  These are the people we call ""savages"".  On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Sometimes it is good to know your >enemy, and if you want to do serious research you have to understand >both sides, and not solely the one and only right one.  Yes, one does.  I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by I think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing that Benjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writings on Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how much he missed.  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and  Aristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus makes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology, the id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus explained it far better and gave reasons.  Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They can screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these men on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly, he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.  Here's some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians that ""that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is  spiritually discerned.""  And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a clue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that's incredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally bizarre.   I can see it, but you can't.  This is not arrogance on my part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless, it is a truth, explainable or not.  Are any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those dot tests they do at the optomologist's?  They put pictures in front of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If your eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals embedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand out from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green, you will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot test appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.  A normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a total anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something. It is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything that to him is as plain as day.  That it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer. The believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patterns fit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the other hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn't see it.  He thinks I am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and say, ""No, you are weird.  You do not see.""   Then it is time for a sanity check.  I go to another Christian and say, ""Do you see this.""  And they go, ""Yes.  It is an ""X"""".  And I say, ""Thank God, I see the ""X"" too.""  It is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension to the phrase,            ""He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.""   I am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see.  I wish every non-believer could see what they are missing. ",talk.religion.misc

Of course, they were baptised, but only after ""God showed that He accepted them by giving them the Holy Spirit"". This means they were already acceptable to God before their baptism, and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven.  In case that seems far-fetched - an ancestor of mine was a missionary who worked among the Hereros in Namibia. Some of the tribesmen were jealous of Christianity, and they poisoned the first convert before he could be baptised. Surely he still went to heaven?

Some BIOSes do not automatically install  COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which  write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call  fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put  ""device=pf.sys"" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat.  This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS  tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and  such also if that is of any value to you.

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

In some circumstances, though, the     organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,     intestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the  disease is commonly called thrush.                                         Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control      pills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.    Among narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve       inflammation.                                                              Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood     tests. Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole. There is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals leads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in      their intestines.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.    Contents:  * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?   * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?    The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.    A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both   cryptography and cryptanalysis.    The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert   ciphertext into plaintext.    A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.    The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,   eavesdroppers, or third parties.  * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?    For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up   to the mid-60's.    Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.    The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].    The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and   networks.    The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.  * How does one go about cryptanalysis?    Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still   classified.    Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.  * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?    In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.    Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this   brute-force search is impractical.        Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].    One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.  * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?    The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.    A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is   probably strong.    A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).        A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.    If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.  * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?    Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he   doesn't have a chance.    Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See   [KAH67].    * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?    Some don't know any better. Often amateurs think they can design   secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst   could do. And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody   to invest the work needed to crack a system. ",sci.crypt

With relays alone, you will always get a transient when you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel.

It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors in switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few thousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which drives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices are cheaper than relays.  	John Whitmore ",sci.electronics

I would just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (""...nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...""). Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as  to the location of the child--this is routine.  A ""computer crime""  prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense,  where a suit by a party injured by ""hackers"" would not.  If I am accused,  for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should  protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however, it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a ""crime"" in the technical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal prosecution.  The answer should certainly be no, but lord only knows how this would work out.

God being unknowable, I can't comment on His motives, but it would be distressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of  our own.  For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all, that His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes  through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex  canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another,  or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free to interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed mediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under- stands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility  for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that  God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source  for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink.    >>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no >>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.   >No. There may be an absolute moral code.

Incidentally, the young child considers the directive >as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.   Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality and politeness.  You might have said ""burp"", for burping and swearing carry about the same stigma today.  If you are talking about ""taking the Lord's  name in vain"" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of  hypocrisy than of varying moral codes.   If there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply absolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes could be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for example, God's code could include, ""Thou shalt not create Beings without a hospitable planet to live on"", but this law would be inapplicable to us. Nevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable to us are also applicable to God.   But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have a sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to follow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category ""morality"" can be sensibly applied. --                                       James Owens  ad354@Freenet.carleton.ca                                      Ottawa, Ontario, Canada ",talk.religion.misc
"  I have a Lightening Scan Pro 256 hand scanner.  It came with scanning/editing software, OCR software, and some plug-in modules for Photoshop et al.  The scanner was a tad on the pricey side ($480), but the scans are incredibly accurate, in 256 level, 300 dpi grayscale.  It also has dithered and line art settings when grayscale isn't desired.  Great scanning software, easy to use.  I frequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image in the note.  Hope this helps! ",comp.sys.mac.hardware

The point he seems to be missing now is that after a certain point accuracy can be very tedious and ridiculous.  See Freeman's next post for an explanation.

First off, I haven't used W4WG (but I think that's about to change!).  The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general (and in this case NETX in particular) adds drives to the device chain.  Setting LASTDRIVE=Z means there are no ""unassigned"" (as opposed to ""unused"") drive letters for NetWare to use, as it tacks its drive mappings -onto the end- of the existing list of drives.  W4WG obviously attaches its network drives to ""existing, unused"" drive letters.  I'd guess the next thing I'd try is something like LASTDRIVE=M, which on most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for W4WG and still allow up to 13 NetWare drive mappings as well.  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  Nick FitzGerald, PC Applications Consultant, CSC, Uni of Canterbury, N.Z.  n.fitzgerald@csc.canterbury.ac.nz  TEL:+64(3)364 2337, FAX:+64(3)364 2332 ",comp.os.ms-windows.misc

If left up to them they would sleep, but that's not an option. They complain that they have no friends that go there, yet don't attempt to make friends. They mention not respecting their Sunday school teacher, and usually find a way to miss Sunday school but do make it to the church service, (after their parents are thoroughly disgusted) I might add.

"   ANNOUNCEMENT:	The ""HyperKnowledge"" PROJECT for NeXTSTEP  Motivation  We are a heterogeneous group of scientists and students who feel that our   work is continuously hindered by computer environments dominated by   incompatible scientific tools and monstrous software packages (too often   claiming to do everything).  Rather than being able to use different tools   together in a flexible, interactive system, we find ourselves spending too   much time converting between different data formats, writing throw-away   tools and I/O parsers, and worrying about how to get to a particular goal   rather than what it means to have attained it.  What we need is an object-oriented scientific environment where the tools   we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system,   highly interactive, and extendable (both by the addition of our own   specialized objects and by combining the available tools - graphically).    The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work,   requiring a very short learning phase and practically no   user-documentation.  The user should feel encouraged to explore different   possibilities, testing his/her own scientific ideas without worrying too   much about whether the system is able to cope (within reason, of course).    By building an open and object-oriented system, each user should be able   to draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a   particular task: we all need to organize and archive our data, display   results, and combine information from many different sources.  Currently, the group consists of people from very different fields:   Molecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, and Geography.    While many of our needs for such an environment diverge, the underlying   motivation is the same: no matter what you want to call it, we need a   system which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific   data and daily work.   Why NeXTSTEP?  What else is there?  No other system offers the same power, a totally   object-oriented developers environment, UNIX-compatibility,   highly-interactive and standardized user-interface.  With the advent of   NS486 and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range   of hardware platforms, such a system will soon be nearly universally   available.  Classical workstation vendors (SUN, IBM, HP, and the rest) now   have little to offer, no similar tools exist for the standard X-Windows   GUI, if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware, and the   mass-market Windows/DOS world is a developer's nightmare (either despite,   or more probably because of, OLE).  In order to progress, we need an open discussion of how best to develop   such an environment.  In NeXTSTEP parlance, do we simply have to put   together a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our   ""Hyper-knowledge"" servers? Should be use distributed objects?  What   minimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the   environment?  What tool-needs do we all have in common and which ones are   best developed by specialized sub-groups?  How many already existing tools   can/should be integrated into the system (e.g. Mathematica)?  Do we need   an ""AVS""-like tool for data-flow manipulation?

The surest route to disaster.  It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or common sense).  Price controls do not, and cannot work.  I would have thought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to  dampen the belief that price controls can actually work.  As for government intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what the are saying.  We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion of the budget and they must be 'controlled'.  We are presented with horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies. We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get in our government run hospitals.  We are just now seeing stories about how Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that should come as any surprise).  And yet, people choose to ignore all of that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to the rescue.  Simply amazing.    James W.

Because I have no past experience in a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional works I have read (And other reasons), I do not believe in any god(s). From what I have seen, some people reconcile this lack of evidence by using faith. It is faith in that sense (the only way I _currently_ understand the word ""faith"") that I find intellectually dishonest.  >>The ambiguity of religious beliefs, an unwillingness to take >>Pascal's Wager,  > >I've heard this frequently - what exactly is Pascal's wager?  Pascal's wager goes something like this: Premise #1: Either there is or there isn't a God. Premise #2: If God exists, He wants us to believe and will damn us for not believing. Premise #3: If God does not exist, then belief in God doesn't matter because death is death, anyway. Conclusion: Belief in God is superior to non-belief because non-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong, while belief in God only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong.  Sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. The problem is, Premise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. This is flat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and the fact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. I have heard theists referred to as ""99% atheists"" because they believe in their god (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence of this is ""what if I pick the wrong god?"" Suddenly, the odds don't look so good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another god's version of hell.  >>	Do I sound ""broken"" to you? > >I don't know.

It certainly consititutes  >disillusionment.  I don't see how ""disillusionment"" enters into it. You see, I presented my mother's treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism, a questioning which continues to this day. I had already been an atheist for five years before having any contact with my mother's version of Christianity. If anything, I had become somewhat disillusioned with atheism (uh, oh, I thought, What if there *is* a God?). Yes, in a way, I have also become disillusioned by many religions, simply because I had thought at one time that they had all the answers, if I only found the right one. I'm still looking, but each time I look in a different place, I become a little stronger in my attitude (belief, if you will, no faith, though, it's based on the evidence of past experience) that I'll never find a religion which has all the answers. Sorta like looking for Easter eggs. The more time it takes you to find the next one, the more convinced you become that you may already have found all the eggs you're going to find. Someone else mentioned that critisism isn't going to make me think any more highly of Christians. I have a contrary position: Constructive critisism will likely improve my attitude towards Christians. Abusive critisism will turn me off. No accusations to you, Mr. Sapienza.

Is it always this way?) then we are going to have trouble finding the > true value of DHs using the same models as that for position players.  There are several reasons for this difference.  The main reason is that good hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull) are rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a place to put aging veterans.  Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did during the rest of the season.  A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first or the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason.  Reggie Jackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he hit like the old Reggie when he was in right.  The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60 at DH will count only in the right fielders' averages.  > 	A logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement > value (if you can find it) for 1B or LF or something.

Although the *average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left fielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly lower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job anywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH.   -- David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu ""We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.""

Right.  Unfortunately for you, it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden too.  I think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy, too.  You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door.  As I understand it, that is not the case; we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the German people.  > civilians suffer.

That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.    Dave also writes:  III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because  		they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)  		parts of the canon.    	then I answer:   		These is a logically invalid *a priori*.   		Besides, we are talking about OT texts-   		which in many parts are superceded by the NT  		(in the Xtian view). Would not this same  		principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?  		This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn ""Now Thank We All Our God"" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.

" First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat, not humans.  Secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  This is an uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in layman's terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be turned into heat.  2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlled amounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the reduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous. It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than play around with 2,4-DNP.  But if you insist, I suggest you look up the literature in your own university library.  You can obtain 2,4-DNP by taking a first year organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it's a commonly-used reagent). ",sci.med

No, there is something called the ""Delany Amendment"" which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the 1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.  This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are banned.  This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good, and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned. This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.  If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone would do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect.  An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as ""gumbo file'"". This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  This is not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its natural form, so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemption was made, to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats. ",sci.med

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  Ezek 22:26 God seems to be upset with the priests who have made no difference between the holy and the profane.  This brought to my mind a sermon I heard recently in which the speaker said ""God's second name does not begin with a D"" referring, I believe, to use of God's holy name and titles as swear words.  I was also reminded of the experience of Moses at the burning bush when God told him ""Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.""  These and other texts seem to imply that God's people must treat holy things differently from other ""common"" things, or ""make a difference"" between holy and common things.  The obvious questions are   What makes something holy? and How are Christians (primarily) supposed to make this difference between holy and common things?  (e.g. God's name, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Bible, etc.)  Darius ",soc.religion.christian
" Just to follow up on Casper's posting. I have been following this business since it started 52 days ago.  The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt. Carmel location for some years, and their neighbors (you know, the people next door) have said to a man, that the BD folks were quiet and never bothered anybody.  There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within the movement, but how does this bring in the Feds? In particular what interest would ATF have in child abuse. O.K. It was the allegation of possesing illegal automatic weapons.  A search warrant could have been obtained (properly) only on probable cause. This means that some evidence that an illegal auto weapon was shipped in, or an illegal kit for converting semi-auto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped.  In either case, how does this require an NO-KNOCK warrent, with a bunch of macho hot dog assholes busting into the place *without* identifying themselves. Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway. It is no surprise they shot when invaded. Hell I am not a religious extremist and I might have done the same myself. If the DEA busted into my house by mistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand, I would shoot first and wonder later.  So if it was illegal guns, the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant (how can you flush a 50 calibre machine gun down the toilet?) and presented it in a peaceful normal way. David Koresh has had brushes with the law, even standing trial for attempted murder in which he was acquitted. In every prior brush with the law, Koresh and his people acted peacibly. There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks to indicate that they were any danger to society.  NOTE: The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists or slight daft is totally irrelevant. It is *not* against the law to be looney or zany.  Look and learn folks.

What I was referring to was not fraud look-alike companies, but ones that made cheap 'GM' etc parts for restoring cars.  They were sold as NON-name brand parts, but had all of the 'look', so your car would be restored to true GM, and not brand XYZ.  As you pointed out, they're a lot cheaper, so the not as die-hard restorer can afford them too.  This is all from what I've read in automotive magazines over the last few years, and apparently the car companies turned a sympathetic eye, because they didn't make the parts anymore.  >Are you really saying that Ford and GM are having companies beat up for >infringing copyright on parts they don't make?

No, but is tell me whether or not the following scenario is realistic: 1) el-cheapo companies make and sell 'GM' parts AS GM originals. 2) GM gets annoyed, and lobbies for a bill to stop anyone from labelling  parts as name brand unless they actually are.., or pushes for heavier enforcement of current fraud laws. 3) Zealous officers raid the previously mentioned small companies, mostly because they didn't have a specific licensing agreement to make the parts that GM no longer makes.

The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which     much of the net community has settled. Please DON'T bring them up again     unless there's something truly new to be discussed. The net can't set     public policy, that's what your representatives are for.       WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     ""scooped"" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].      To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to     pursue are:      A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel     Salisbury in ""Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG     Controversy,"" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year 	  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year 	  Shuttle sources:	  725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.      Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space     Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR     Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical     Research, 95, 18583-18590, 1990.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly ""the bends"", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School     of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.       HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE ""FACE ON MARS""      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop  pass at his own blue line, and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat  Tommy to the stick side. The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald  was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy  to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed  on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest  periods I've seen Sweden play this year.  Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many  times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial  save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal  from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way  to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a  nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4  just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of  the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole.   Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled  through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,  Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close  range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,  and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.

Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just  deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play  goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the  far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.  Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of  the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.  Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya  entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,  then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to  deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.  The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side  and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.    Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri  Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and  in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,  and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros  after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.   Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,  7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player  (among those Kariya with 1+6).

It's a letter from Jerry Berman to David Chaum from November of 1985, in response to information that Mr. Chaum sent to Mr. Berman.  While I have to congratulate EFF for its prompt response to the Clipper Chip announcement from the White House, I think it's important to recognize the philosophy of their Executive Director, as explained below.  I agree that legal remedies are important, but when pressed, I'd prefer to retain the ability to use purely technical solutions to preserve my privacy, because they'll hold up under fire.  Mr. Chaum has consented to the publication of this letter on the Net.   I don't work for, nor am I a member of EFF, ACLU, or any similar organizations, but I do agree with them on a great many things.   					--Aristophanes  ----------                        AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION                          WASHINGTON OFFICE                                                                                                                             122 Maryland Avenue, NE  November 1, 1985                                   Washington, DC 20002                                                     --------------------                                                     National Headquarters Mr. David Chaum                                     132 West 43rd Street     Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science         New York.

A society of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  the time and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' to avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother obsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever present.  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia.  	As a matter of  principle,  we  are  working  to  enact  formal legal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on technical solutions.   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which respects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the law, requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions.  e.g. require  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data communications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption that regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power and invade privacy.  	As a  matter  of  practicality,  I  do  not  think  your  system offers much hope for privacy.    First, the trend toward universal identifiers  is  as  much.-a  movement  generated  by  government  or industry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions. At best,  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most would opt for  simplicity.  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  would never use or benefit from it.  	Finally where there's a  will, there's  a  way. If  government wants to link data bases, it  will,  by  law, require  the  disclosure of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it for data bases which the government wants to link.      Since corporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   one another, they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted, will use ""fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes used by their customers to other firms.  	The solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limits on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual autonomy.  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to override it. It cannot be used as a substitute for such consensus.

If you are referring to the terms ""effeminate"" and ""homosexuals"" in the above passage, I agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged.  However, I was simply commenting on the charge that it is an ""incredibly perverse"" interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality.  Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse. Therefore I do not believe it is ""incredibly perverse"" to read it in this way.  >I think your argument from fornication is circular.  Why is >homosexuality wrong?  Because it's fornication.

After all, a couple doesn't have to be married by a minister.  A secular justice of the peace could do the job, and the two people would be married.  My point was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage between two people of the same sex?  And if you do see a biblical basis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to ""save themselves"" for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be willing to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject.  I have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual, yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to be Christian would advocate such a position.  So what is the gay view?  - Mark  [Yes, I agree that a reasonable person might conclude that Paul is condemning homosexuality.  I was responding to certain details of your posting.  That doesn't mean I agree with Michael in all respects.  --clh] ",soc.religion.christian
" You want to speed up ballgames?  1.  Enforce the two minutes between innings.  As it is, many fields are     allowing THREE minutes between them.  Fifteen seconds before      TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon     the return to the game.  Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or     a ball is called.  2.  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it.  They may get     pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher     throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.  3.  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current     rule is too lenient), and then enforce it.  Fifteen seconds is more     than enough time.  If the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball,     and restart the clock.  Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours in the AL.  That's just too damn long.  I don't like to PLAY in 3 hour games, much less WATCH a game for that long.

If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.  Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.

This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be ""heavy"".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

"  	A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically every few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extreme tiredness followed by:  	1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows, 	knees, and hips. 	2. generalized muscle pains 	3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears 	4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day 	5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral    retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (She         isn't diabetic--they checked. 	6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone 	   poles do not appear to be straight) 	7. loss of peripheral vision.  	 	Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something  called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The only thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  At times she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg the symptoms become acute again.  	She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming worse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs she has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop it.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in  advance.

"Message-ID: <1qmfpt$sut@usenet.INS.CWRU.Edu> NNTP-Posting-Host: hela.ins.cwru.edu       I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he  had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.     Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: Morning show:   In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi,  and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12 Noon:   I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story.   I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host.  12 Noon to 2 PM:   At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to  Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability to transcend the ""homer"" mentality of the Philadelphia fan base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia  spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan. Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys') I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.  2PM to 4PM:   This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and  Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which are often hilarious.    4 PM to 7 PM:   MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.   I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the  reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.  7 PM to Midnight:   S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show) On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season. (If this is the sports station, why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.)) During the summer, it is all talk on WIP.   Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

I pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues such as this.  This issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and time again.  The bottom line is this: in normal circumstances, both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of circumcision are minor.  This means that the decision is left to the religious, cultural, ethical, and aesthetic mores of the parents, at best, or to the habit of the concerned hospital or caregivers, at worst.   As (prospective) parents, you should do what you want in this regard and not worry about it too much.  In terms of decisions you make for your child, it will have far less importance than many -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents think about only a little.   This question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a momentous medical decision.  It is not.  Russell ",sci.med

Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102,     says:  	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is 	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower 	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program) 	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a 	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other 	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort 	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of 	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining 	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target 	in second stage.""      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack 	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the 	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line 	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly 	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of 	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z 	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading."" 	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the 	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.      3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more 	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or 	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be 	the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").      4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated 	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort 	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver 	complexity"").      5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio 	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio 	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").      6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a 	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is 	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east 	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity 	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember: 	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. 	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its 	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""     [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll     maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.

During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

This is >an issue that may be very personal, but is important.  What does >the Bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with >regard to this issue?  This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much, and probably has not been studied much.  As some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up to speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by personality type summary file.  One observation is that people have significantly different personalities (no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.  My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted (there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am quite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing. (BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the Body).  Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is excerpted from my summary:  1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:          Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside                           world of people, activities or things.          Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal                           world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.   Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities to fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

In particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book ""Colon Cleansing for Health and Longevity"" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics, along with certain orally ingested ""debris-loosening agents"", boosts the immune system to a significant degree.  He also plugs a unique appliance called the ""Colema Board"", which facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over $100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash, supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its bulkiness.  If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very interested to hear about research and personal experience.

"Nntp-Posting-Host: bobr.csc.liv.ac.uk  Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function ""XmuCvtStringToWidget"". I want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect two widgets together on an XmForm. ie.  MyProggy*MyListSW.topWidget:               MainTextSW  However, when I run the program, I get the message:  Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion.  (Just like the manual sez).  I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way to go about this:      static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {         {             XtWidgetBaseOffset,             (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec, core.parent ),             sizeof(CoreWidget)         }     };      XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString, XtRWidget, XmuCvtStringToWidget,                             parentCvtArgs, XtNumber(parentCvtArgs), XtCacheAll,                                NULL );   However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it says that I can add it to a widget's ""class_intialize"" function. HOW? What's one of those? :-(  If anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - I'm sure this is a FAQ.  Thanks in advance,  Rik.

""mothership"" except for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a ""Grand Tour"" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt  that the idea of a big ""mother ship"" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a probe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large ""bus"" spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination. The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond. The ""bus"" could have included far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore. Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a relatively great distance. --- The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the ""real"" Voyagers, and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in addition two ""sub-probes"" could have been relased at Saturn, examining that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory-related factors. A small ""swarm"" of camera-equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a  small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy,  well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of course.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an ""air core resonant transformer"". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called ""Oscillating Shuttle Circuit"" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????  GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!  If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century. (flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).  ----  ET   ""Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time.

The founder of this movement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to  be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures of almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the  fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.          The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of  divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial- ly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to  openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims has been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United Nations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns  against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the members of this movement, but so far to no avail.          Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont- inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the world in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul- tural backgrounds.          The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards developing a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli- gious intolerance and fundamentalism.          Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's internal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa- tion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of professionals as well as world class individuals.          The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal brotherhood.   NEWSGROUP CREATION:  ==================          The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi- cially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news- group gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more ""YES/Create"" votes than ""NO/don't create"" votes; the newsgroup shall be created.    ABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER:  ====================          Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of this newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the proposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation for the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora- do, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the newsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third party.  QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS: =====================          Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup may be sent to:      Nabeel A. Rana  <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu>          Any questions or problems in voting should be sent to:      Anthony Lest    <lest@ucsu.colorado.edu> ",soc.religion.christian

" I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer.  The design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM.  The idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM.  The secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used. The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  This was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in operation.  The case, of course, might not be the same for your 1993 RX-7!  The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated.  Since steering angle and velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers' use of the car.  I am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ECM.  While it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style, it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars. I personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.   --  Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED ",rec.autos
" I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick.  After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.  For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year.

That's less |than eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrain |and reschedule the EVA's in that time. |  Where's wingo when you need him:-)  COme on.   Knock that S**T off.  YOu forget,  that during skylab,  they did  overnight mission planning for the repair EVA's.   Also during theøÄ    Intelsat Mission,   they did overnight  WETF simulations. I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months.  And as for building hardware,  anything can  be built if you want it bad enough.  YOu forget,  the  BUS 1  is already built.  all they'd ahve to do is soup it up, even test it  on a delta mission.  Don't get into this mode of  negativism.   besides,  at the rate missions slip,   the Discovery won't launch on this mission until March.  that's almost a year.  |More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it |was going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you've added significant |extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware. |  Ah,  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission.  YOu forget,  there is a bum FGS,  the Solar array electronics, are getting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission.  The time for the space walks are growing rapidly.  THis was orignally planned out as 3 spacewalks,  now they are at 5 EVA's  with 3 reserve walks.  If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's $500 million saved.  If the Weight savings,  means they  can sit on orbit  for 30 Days. and  handle any contingency  problems,  that's quite a savings.  | |According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are |only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and |AXAF.  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle, |there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle.   Of course,  there wasn't any need for the Saturn  V  after apollo too.  as for the problems with the aperture door,  I am sure they can work out some way to handle  that.  Maybe a Plug  made from Frozen ice.?   it'll keep out any contamination, yet sublime away  after teh boost.  pat  ",sci.space

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is: 	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd., 	00196 Rome Italy, 	Piazzale Flaminio, 19 	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.     For more info contact:    Essence Info    Apex Software Publishing    405 El Camino Real Suite 121    Menlo Park CA 94025 USA  [ What about Texture City ?? ]  ==========================================================================  14. Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in   ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  ""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it""    ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send   E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.  Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI   database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from   a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default   directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different   ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to   contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI ""database"").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""   in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

Look at the whole picture, not just randomly picked libertarian positions.  If government is not allowed to use ""non-initiated force"" to achieve its goals, than no special interest can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.  The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic which I'll address briefly.  It certainly won't happen until libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education monopoly, so we have to be creative.  The Advocates for Self-Government reports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants ""embrace"" libertarianism. That's the best means I've seen yet.  We should lobby for compulsory Seminar 1 attendance. :) [in jest!]  Roger Collins  It's amazing to me that governments around the world will try every aspect of government control before, as a final last resort after everything else fails, they will try individual liberty. 	-- Andre Marrou, Libertarian candidate for President '92 ",talk.politics.misc

Also called sarcasm.  The usual procedure is to accept some part of the 'oppositions' arguement and run with it until one goes beyond 'rational thought' and then ring the changes.  z.B. The idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one. And in these times of economic difficulty, the Washington legislature is propossing to raise the State MinWage from $4.25 (the federal level) to $4.90 (fifteen cents over Oregon's). 	It would seem to me that this increase does not keep pace with inflation, that the minimum wage should be to $6.08 by my figures, so it is proposed that we raise the minimum wage to $6.50 per hour by 1 July and then give a 10% cost of living increase every 4 July.  and anyone who doesn't like it is obviously a country club republican getting rich off the exploitation of poor people.  chus pyotr  --  pyotr@halcyon.com Sometimes Pyotr Filipivich, sometimes Owl.

Remember 'Cyprus'?  >   I have to say I vehemently disagree with you, I have seen  Too bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established  a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two  continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and  Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in  espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and  Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under  German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National  Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional  Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic,  Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often  expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary, during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  ""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical  operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.""   Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.   ""...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities   against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the    murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian    neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish    and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see    the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...   Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

You ride the roller coaster because it's an thrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out of you.  In the same way, I think life is fun.

"Message-ID: <1qkb9k$788@vela.acs.oakland.edu> NNTP-Posting-Host: vela.acs.oakland.edu  I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine, but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.  The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0  The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991 They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone). There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.  When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.   Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I would not even know how to do that.  Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number for Western Digital might just do as good!  swood  --         Hunting over in Michigan?

I think this is a little inaccurate, based on Feynman's account of the software-development process *before* the standdown.  Fred is basically correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software. Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care. (None of the experimenters could afford it.) --  All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry ",sci.space

You see, this country has this thing called a ""constitution"".  If you legitimately aquire the device, and you yourself are not a government employee or otherwise encumbered, I don't think they can stop you from revealing anything about the device you can determine. Remember the Pentagon Papers precedent? The First Amendment applies here.  The U.S. does NOT have an official secrets act. We do have laws that will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned in your capacity as a government official, contractor, etc, and we have laws that prohibit stealing such information. However, if they sell you the chip, I can't see that they can make reverse engineering it and revealing the details illegal.  -- Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com -- Laissez faire, laissez passer.

"  Printer model and specification:  Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier) ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)   Hello,  We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer.  We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The  copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the printer with the ""lp"" system using the parallel interface and can print  postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in  turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a  publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts  are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of  programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript  with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98  rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that  acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript.  We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality  pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the  SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a  warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without  some assurance that the product will work.   Here my questions:  If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or  parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?  Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the limiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on  the printer?   The Big question:  Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?    Please email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis.  I will post a summary.  Thanks in advance.  --  	E-mail:		scott@ncifcrf.gov ,Phone #:	(301) 846-5798         Title:  	Sr. Systems Manager/Analyst ",comp.graphics

Of course, that's also how the Bolivarian Republic started (ca. 1800-1820) in central america.  It didn't have quite the staying power of the USA.  I'm sure there are more examples of going far away and then ignoring authority, but none jump to mind right now.  >What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your >services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what >ever..

They look like cylinders >that have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what the >actual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they're called >'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?  Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.  Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage ""hot"" turbine to final stage ""cold"" turbine).

Let me tell you a story then...  One evening not long in this country a man, a parolee, a convicted KNOWN  violent crimminal lead police on high speed chase after breaking another law. He decided that police had no right to do their jobs and enforce the law and assualted two of while attempting to resist arrest.  When police use metal sticks to force him into submission we heard all the reason why certain people in this country have and excuse when they refuse to obey the law,  how this was a perfect example of police oppression, how all the police had to do was behave a certain way and all would have been finei, how nothing the victim did could have possibly warranted the response - some blows with a few sticks - he got from the authorities.  Funny, how when it's Bloodbath Billy or his hitwench calling the shots, a group of people who were bothering no one, were not know to have broken  any law, who asked only that they be left alone to practice their religion as they fit, how it is now that the government is justified in assualting those people with 100 heavily armed commandos simply because the gun  grabbers in DC thought these people had more guns thay they thought they should have.  Now when it's the Clinton administration that has the blood of dozens on its hand AAAALL of a sudden it's the people who refused to have their civil rights violated, it's their fault, those evil fanatics provoked it...  How is it in the mind of the liberal Democrat-Clinton supporter that a crimminal puke, scum bag, piece of garbage like Rodney King could not have possibly provoked the beating he got, but this bunch of wierdos could cause  a fifty one day stand off that ended with the burning deaths of all of them and their children, all by themselves with no help from the the police.   And to here people say they deserved what they got, to hear Clinton say the blame rest solely with Koresch, what a cowardly piece of work that man has shown, again, himself to be.  WE'RE blaming the right people.  It is you and others that defend ANY of the actions of the BATF, FBI or Justice Department in this matter, that with  each word prove again and again the depth of the hypocrisy, the double standard that people like the Clintons would hold certain Americans to.  While at the same time allowing others to do as they please with only  excuses to offer their victims.  It's all to clear these days, from the comments of the ""president"" and the rationalizations of his supporters in these groups, that in a liberal Democratic vision of America only a certain select few people can expect to have civil rights enforced,  and this administration intends to enforce laws, apply the Constitution and obey the laws only when it suits them to do so.

The remainder of the day will be spent learning how to write objects in C++ and practicing.  ------------------------------  1993 Andrew Technical Conference and Consortium Annual Meeting June 24-25, 1993 Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA  The conference will be held on the last Thursday and Friday in June.  A tutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the 25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the two days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting, though only Consortium members will be able to vote.  This year's theme is   	Application Construction by Non-Programmers  Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer construction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will consider questions such as 	What is needed for application construction by non-programmers? 	Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed? 	Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to create new widgets? 	Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves?  Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including  	applications 	experience with users 	new objects 	reviews of and proposals for revision of  		internal Andrew protocols  We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would like to do a demonstration.    Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993. Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.  Send papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.

I don't think this ""same reason"" applies >to Somalia at all.  No, you have completely misunderstood.  I was opposed to intervention in Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the lives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us to take on all of them.  In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the US.  >The whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country, and we were more >willing to send troops there than to Bosnia--exactly the _opposite_ of what >the ""fixation on European countries"" theory would predict.  (Similarly, the >desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite >of what that theory predicts.)  You continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this word, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as racist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result of it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and 3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side would be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite the fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news I see are any guide.

And that's ok with me.  The present keeps me perfectly busy.  -jim halat  ",alt.atheism
"  I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question, because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000. 	Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :  	typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)  but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one, as the prototype suggests.  For example:  	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)  Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h, or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions. 	Many thanks in advance for any help.  -- <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> Bill Woodward        | wpwood@austin.ibm.com   <-- Try this first AIX Software Support | billw@aixwiz.austin.ibm.com   Graphics Group       | 512-838-2834 I am the terror that flaps in the night.

There was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results of a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual.  I saw another figure that listed 2% as the figure.  Of course, even if it were 99% that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior. How many people have commited other acts of fornication?  How many people have lied or sinned in other ways?  >But in all fairness, the ""shameless"" nature of their acts is a >reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a >specific feature of homosexuality.  Why isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality?  Paul describes ""men with men working that which is unseemly"" to describe the acts.   Sure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other sins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of  man's not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their acts were shameless.  >homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the >other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the >subject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality >in passing.  Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament? Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the Spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also protects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a two edged sword that cuts both ways.    I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.   If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature, then those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.   If homosexuality were ""natural"" (whatever that means) wholesome,  endorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded biggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of it in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that this was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty crime!    Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at I Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.  There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in  Leviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides this one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife.    Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan  coustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact taking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles.  It was just a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or not.  >One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds >of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality >only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was >wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act >""straight"" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying >to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian >ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the >relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's >judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make >judgements on these questions.  One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can be tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin, like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse. God is greater than all of it.   Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many  people have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed. That is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not God's willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that uses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to change them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other sin.  >I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is >not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's >tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating >holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues >to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to >avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging. >For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat >meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about >which they had personal qualms.   I don't see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul's dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols. Paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with eating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others.    But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to tough.  Paul wrote to ""make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.""  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.  Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.   Since others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul's approach on pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should  sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual ""marriage"") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered  a more damaging sin.  >For another example, Paul obviously >would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances) >remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly >would rather see them married than in a state where they might be >tempted to fornication.  Yet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something that God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.  > Note that in the >creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This >doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  Actually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell. After he fell he would have to toil over the ground.  >The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often >fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from >psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when >attempts at living as a heterosexual fail.  That is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious position to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just like anyone else.  >but I can well imagine Paul >preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian >relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis >suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such >relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love >with each other.  I'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this  conclusion.  It's like saying, ""How should I kill myself, with gun or aresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat, or all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts? Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?    In all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher the chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with  physical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all  leads to spiritual death.  >Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their >relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul >would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of >argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.  The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the actual act.  Second, isn't it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having ""loving relationships?""  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual ""love."" (btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.  Also, where do you get that tax collectors are sinners.  That's certainly not explicit.  Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job.)  Link Hudson.   [I'm reluctant to comment in this in detail.  Our basic concepts of the intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly different.  As I indicated in the article, whatever the ambiguities of various words (and I still think they are significant), it does seem clear that Paul considered the homosexuality he saw around him wrong.  What you do with this fact depends upon your basic approach to the Bible.  I'm afraid that communication between legalist and anti-legalist Christians is even harder than between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th Cent.  Since you disagree with my starting point, obviously you're going to disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions. Sometimes discussion is still useful.  I've seen some very interesting work on Paul done by Jews.  Obviously they don't agree with him, but they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant.  But I don't see much sign for hope here.  In talk.religion.misc there's an axiom that by the time Hitler's name is invoked, all hope for sensible discussion is gone.  On this subject, when sleeping with goats is invoked, I don't think there's enough basis for understanding to be worth pursuing.  --clh] ",soc.religion.christian

" Hello Folks,  I'm very happy with my ""new"" R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons... that's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting something rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much anyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a  torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still (when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are  my questions:  1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the wind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds (70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my vision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece  detachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.  2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the crash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it  really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the  headlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators don't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm puttering around in the dirt at low RPM?    3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing in the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section of the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing?   4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline with alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any  particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a purse.  If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the need for functional women's clothing.

" Fellow netters,  I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has one.  I have my eye on two choices.  Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.  Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.  I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149).    Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy?  If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.

" I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.  In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude picture:   ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  |  |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+  |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +  |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +  |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |  ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack, with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.  The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming.  Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this:      +---------+     + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+  to this:                     +---------+                    + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+   ===============  Okay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this into the next ""official"" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm, and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?  One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)  In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing, look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:          +=========+   +---------+   +=========+         + title B +   + title A +   + title C +         +-------------------------------------+         +   this is the body of the window,   +         +   window A, which is on top.        +         +-------------------------------------+   ===================  The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long.  The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:  #ifdef SHAPE 	case F_SQUEEZELEFT: 	{	static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 }; 		if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor)) 		  return TRUE;  		tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze; 		SetFrameShape( tmp_win ); 		break; 	} 	.... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and 	squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif  ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { ""f.squeezeleft"", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c  In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file:  Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter   =================  About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out.  Since then, ""blast"" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19, Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title. Better to have a twm-style window manager, I think.  -- Ralph Betza (FM), uunet!ssiny!gnohmon         gnohmon@ssiny.com  ""The question of whether a computer can swim is more interesting  than the question of whether a submarine can think"" - Lenny Dykstra ",comp.windows.x

Call up Crown, the company that has the patent on the PZM, and ask them for information on construction and use of the things.  You may have to determine the correct spacing emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the design of the Panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of the electret element to increase the high frequency response, and you are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance.  Crown has a nice book on the subject, though it's unfortunately rather short on mathematics.  There's a JAES article from many years back, too.  Still, for your application, you'll be a lot better off buying the cheap Radio Shack models and using Phil Rastoczny's modifications to get a clean balanced output.

How wrong you will be.  I participated in the last National March on   Washington (MOW) for LesGayBi rights (Oct 11, 1987) - with a turnout of   about 750,000 people - and we didn't have alot pissing us off at the time.    The big issue was the AIDS crisis, but we weren't being slapped around   quite as bad as we are now.  This time its AIDS, and Equal Rights,  and   the Military Squabble.  And this MOW has been in the planning for YEARS   whereas the last one was pulled together in a relatively short time.  The   last MOW was the largest ever on D.C. and you can bet we are going to   exceed that by a long shot.  I truly believe we will exceed the 1.0   million goal the MOW committee has always had set for this event.  - Todd Allyn Houts - email: t-houts@uiuc.edu OR houts@zelda.ehs.uiuc.edu - MESSAGE OF THE DAY:  5 days til MOW  ",talk.politics.misc

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give  your question a shot.   The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really  have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need  10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your  pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not  toner.  But that should go without saying.  My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little  while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once  the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.    The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or  HP wouldn't sell many......  Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built  like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.  Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like  a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.  Not  as impressive.    So, I chose the Canon.  Any other opinions? ",comp.os.ms-windows.misc

" --  Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom.   As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low  numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great!  It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.   I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those  who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.   ( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should be road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about  the transmission and taking my chances.  Being a reletively new reader, I am quite impressed with all the usefull info available on this newsgroup.

For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.  Philip ",sci.crypt

Women's pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too shallow to use!  I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when she goes from building to a car. It is protect herself from would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who as a definite place of safty (ie a locked car!).  Puting keys and walet looks ugly! It breaks the lines and makes you rear look wide as a cows!   Also, to have the habits that work for any clothing situation, the pruse functions no mater what you are wearing! (even nude or a bikni)  A women's suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets (2 on the outside, none on the inside). I have men's coats that have as much as 6 pockets! This is definitally not fair!!!  As one that wears both men's and women's clothes, I can tell you, women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets!  When dressed as a man, I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and my keys in a coat outside pocket. It is much more covenent than the pants pockets and looks better.  Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is paramout to a woman's safty. Men don't see this as a problem. A woman is aware of this every time she goes out!

One more way, which works in manual trans cars I've driven, and it is my personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this one, too).    While pushing the shifter *gently* towards reverse, let the clutch out slowly (right to the friction point) and the shifter will be pulled into position.

The only reason they are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because it's DEAD!    Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be  completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.    Some of you worry WAY too much.

Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that    was like 30 sec. I think they should give more attention to NHl during    the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..     I guess it is NHL's fault too for leaving ESPN. Hope things improve    by next season...

Not only because it is the polite thing to do, but also to avoid addressing ladies with ""Mr."", as you have done.  Secondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled as Cyprus has never been Greek, but rather, it has been home to a bi-communal society formed of Greeks and Turks. It seems that you know as little about the history and the demography of the island, as you know about the essence of Turkey's  military intervention to it under international agreements.  Be that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what is going on today on Azerbaijani land, can only be drawn with the expansionist policy that Armenia is now pursuing.

In this case, it was unimportant as to who set the fire.  The Davidians would have burned no matter what, ESPECIALLY if the BATF/FBI set the fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to Vernon Howell and therefore rocket to heaven.

To the North Pole!          On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON      rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan      Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe      for the planet Venus.           Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing     yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the     planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic     VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core     was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of     propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by     the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels     were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large     amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The     dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger      to properly transmit this information to Earth.           Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed     the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)     POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a     terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by      the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'     surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles).           The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over     the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects      no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the     VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations      made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the      island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern     pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or      PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially      interesting geological features worthy of investigation.          On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330      million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections,      VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a      polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around      the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA      16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus'      first polar-circling spacecraft.          Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20      for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north     pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers      (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.       The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over      the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back      to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took      eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions      in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers      (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.          VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more     complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills,      mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape,      many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the      last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean      surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the      largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids      would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles)      across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.          There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists     on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes'      owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the      summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest      mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American      scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell      was a huge volcano sitting on the northern ""continent"" of Ishtar Terra.            In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about     Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later     in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar     (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-     nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be      called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan      (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even      finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet      probes maintained that distinction.          Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted     next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the      Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's     temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about     five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few     locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating      current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds      over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles)      lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty      kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees      warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.          When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were      plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at      more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to      pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control     gas to perform the operation.            VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving      the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six      hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an      atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.          Venus by Balloon          For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting      target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of      air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of      the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)     had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint      French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless,      late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.          When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21,      the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full      views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe      since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.          The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named     VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei     being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft      have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one      celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.            This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to      the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.     Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from     the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists      around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such      bodies which actually come close to Earth.            Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar      system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall      in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice      and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar      encounter.          The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and     Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not     wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a     close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical     GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the      comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and      SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance.           Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet     from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel     powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget     cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to     make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of      data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter      and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor      John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.          The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building     an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify     their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an      advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,     the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of      the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the      U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier.      The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the      location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive      in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.          As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA     1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander     making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the     upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers     (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released     by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)     altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had     successfully arrived.           One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was     pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a     diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen     meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as     an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat     consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment     point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,     and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for     measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special     white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which     permeated the planet's atmosphere.           The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just     north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag      would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened      hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.       This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as      well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.       The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar      to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists      had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight      due to the permanently thick cloud cover.          The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day     hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600     kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did     not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer     (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers     (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three     main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the     balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers     (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and     down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the     journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius     (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.     The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds.           Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already     headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with     a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13      and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the     composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the     Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen     minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to      accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6      miles) above the surface.           There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before     touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not     only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of     Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never      before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature      and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees      Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's      56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background      infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.          As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and      12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data     returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The     French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine,      and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active      volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.     The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air     between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)     contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.          The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks      appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.     The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results     nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers      instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were      three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50      and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a     thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles),      much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-     cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air      over the last seven years.          When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last      functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on     for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around     the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March     6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the      dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.     The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial     bodies with one space vessel.          On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for     a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2     balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking     it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning     side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)     flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still     environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.     After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent      for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-     kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the ""continent"" of Aphrodite      Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5      miles) towards the surface.          Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air      layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius      (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1     balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed      through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning     were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer      failed to function.          The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite     Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900     miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother     than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a     relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in     working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite,      rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in      aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree      of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured      463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,     essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.          Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at     a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin      to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030      kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet      is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers      (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three      hours.          Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley     encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the      probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-     Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance      of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets      had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly      a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was      not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.       VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.          Future Plans Diverted          The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous      ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second      world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for     the early 1990s.          This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple      probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft      would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon      probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's      corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over      the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to      investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible      landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main      Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.          Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in     the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA     mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet     and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space      program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction      was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this      class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next      year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on     Mars' largest moon, Phobos.           All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,     including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and      eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.     The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious     consideration of human colonization in the near future.          But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars     exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,     one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other     going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon     landing in March of 1989.           In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to     ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the     mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put      on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have     since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of     continuous robotic exploration of the planet.           During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change     was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began      to ""open up"" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with      the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the      culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking      a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a ""free market"".          These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.     Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making     almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring     nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to      make money.            In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for      sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price      of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary      probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United      States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.          MAGELLAN and GALILEO           The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration     with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.     Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of     spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most      detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When     MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be     able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108     meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.          In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space      Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit      the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle      ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space,      named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the      probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.          In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on     a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around     Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach     Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary     goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the     planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in     that violent atmosphere.          On the Drawing Boards          With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,     new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-     tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet      Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1,      1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions      within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also     considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.          In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects      as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes     throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected     for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing     of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air     temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed     to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air     with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.     Final project decisions will be made in 1994.          Humans on Venus                Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?     At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure     would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something     even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into     changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like     Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking     will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide      atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability      to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster     than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries     if not millennia.          In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand     Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how     a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became     instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?     Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found     through international cooperation, including the nation which      made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

" Hi there,  We are running a 120 node Token ring with Windows 3.1 and Novell 3.11.  Every once in a while, we run into ""The Black Screen of Death"", a phrase coined by Robert X. Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column.    Basically, sometimes when you quit Windows, the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen.  Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs. Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows' virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company seems to know what I am talking about when I call them.  Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?    Is there a fix for it?  Any response is welcome.

"   I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.   I have a number of X level questions regarding this:  (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be  predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).  I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens, and not multiple X displays.   Given this:  	- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple 	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's 	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between 	screens?  	- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate 	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? 	What are they; who sells them...  	- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a 	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?  	- Is there any way for the application to transparently see 	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware 	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?  	- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a 	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single 	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate 	multiple screens instead)?   	I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely 	on providing config files which will specify for each 	configuration the screen placement of each window in the 	application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience 	are more than welcome.   ======================================================================== Jo Pelkey                                   Phone: (509)375-6947 Battelle Pacific Northwest Labs             Fax:   (509)375-3641 Mail Stop K7-22                             Email: je_pelkey@pnl.gov P.O.

"  I really don't know how you can possibly maintain this hypocritical stance.  On the one hand, you imply that there is a conspiracy of Arab-Americans that warrants the illegal gathering of information on them (ie. auto license/ registration information in California) and other forms of ""monitoring"", including blatant attempts by paid ADL agents to discredit an American-Arab  organization by trying to distribute Nazi propaganda.  Furthermore, you attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing  to the WTC bombing, in which Arab-Americans had no involvement.  On the other hand, you publish this excerpt, which seems to rail against notions of a racial (Jewish, in this case) conspiracy and stereotypes.

"Sender: news@osuunx.ucc.okstate.edu (USENET News System) Nntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine Date: Thu, 22 Apr 1993 21:30:00 GMT  I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed. Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci.  Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women  poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did  not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I  see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.    Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that  balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians  who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go  from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and  then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling  quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a  quack.    I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten  years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I  know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few ""enlightened"" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with ""good"" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with ""good"" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaine's doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to ""treat"" it. If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane ""barrier"".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida ""bloom"" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a ""good"" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from ""Natural Healing"" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved  your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly  seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.

What version of WinFAX do you have?  The newest version (3.0) has an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) built in... what this means is that it can take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ASCII so that one can edit the document w/o re-typing it...

" >How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?  By initiating a DMA xfer.  :)  Seriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't use the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower).  ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or  crash.(I forget)  Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit.  The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.  I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.  In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.  I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.  I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel.  Thanks.  ",comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Ghostview is a postscript previewer that uses ghostscript.  From the ghostview README:        Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript.  Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4.  Brief list of features:   - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring     Conventions.   - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring     Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.   - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.   - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or     application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our     European friends.   - Scrollbars appear when necessary.   - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring     Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.   - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,     and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).   - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale      or color on a Color monitor.)   - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that     printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)   - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution     (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).      The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people     are encouraged to use in other programs.      Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:         prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z         appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z   From the ghostscript README:  ***************************************************** * This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. * *****************************************************  ******** ******** An overview of Ghostscript ******** ********  Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:          - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and          - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the Ghostscript language.  The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely in C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms. Currently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform families:          - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible           graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;          - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,           release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,           Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;           H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX           running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;           Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;          - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;          - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler           version 3.1 or later is required).

Well, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the basics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration. In the case of the Viper, yes, we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder 90-deg. engine, which will sound somewhat like a truck.  And my understanding, btw, is that that V-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad- aptible for either the trucks or the Viper.  And from what I've heard (no first hand knowledge :-( ) it's doing a pretty good job at both.  And the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60-degree DOHC Colombo-designed V-12.  Period.  Michael T.

My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started   showing the same behavior.  I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost   about $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to   rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would   have cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.  The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the   engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky   part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench   rounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.    Wow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt   the new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.  This is quite easy even for a beginner.

"  I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the Expos in 1980 that decided the NL East.  It was also his career high 48th.   Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the 1986 ALCS.  The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox *1* strike away from the pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run. That was the most incredible turn of events I have EVER seen in baseball.  The Sox later took the pennant away only to have the same thing done to them in the WS against the Mets.  Speaking of the METS, isn't it strange how the NLCS that year with the Astros ALMOST mirrored the 1980 NLCS with the Phillies??  The Astros have been painfully close twice I must admit.

" Hi Netters,  As promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0. People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0. (Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0.  However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.  Buddy Christyono buddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------- summary of replies ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello Buddy,  I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.  Here is my suggestion...  1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with 	DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that 	for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other 	utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you  	are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)  2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95 	for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I 	decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost! 	I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with 	large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It 	works great.  Not delays.  I think the ""A"" is better than ""B""  	arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance. 	I am looking forward to being able to ""LOADHIGH"" the DD sw.  That 	has been an annoyance.  3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the 	effort to upgrade.  Just my $.02 ...  Regards, Mark Bagdy ---------------------------------------------------------------- Buddy,  I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.  There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max & QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a 203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had ~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and such).  I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very happy camper.  -Bruce --    Bruce F.

Software Technical Support Engineer |               Sam Gamgee   Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp.   |      <My mail, My Opinions> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  	I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on a 486DX 33Mhz, 120MB Seagate drive, running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced mode. 	I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache. 	I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install. The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem.  There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive. 	Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady  around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files  are compressed image files and some large zip files.    If you have any more specific questions let me know. Dan ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  I bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40 MB drives.

It seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Who has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing to be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical research is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that these interests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight.  As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH didn't find them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! I tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting like hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their survival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna- tive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find- ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless.  gn ",sci.med

There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's Extremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both. But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim ""low emissions"" but not specifically ""MPR-II Compliant"" or ""MPR-II Certified"" only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other. 	So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis- tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low emissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know you may be more discerning.  Good luck!  					- Mitch  					v063kcbp@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu   (Oh yeah: I got my Hitachi Superscan 15 from Insight for $499.)

The alternative approach (to CISC),  which has been adopted by many in  recent years, has come to be known as ""RISC"": the Reduced  Instruction Set Computer.  This can be characterised simply as  ""Simpler is Faster""; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing  the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be  designed to run faster.  Even at the cost of needing more  instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,  faster design.   A typical RISC processor will:      o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);      o perform all data operations on registers;      o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');      o only allow load & store operations to access memory;      o only use a few instruction formats;      o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).

There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI.  There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements.  My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through to SG.  I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD. The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.  Gordon Lang ",comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Obviously, if a ""truth"" is not always ""true"" then we have a >> contradiction in terms.    I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a waste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.  For example, I recently was asking some children the question ""What temperature does water boil at?""  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked if they knew what scale, and was told ""It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale. That's what all thermometers say.""  Well, that's sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of  the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.   [example of head-covering in Church deleted]  This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I  see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.   >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  >to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) >Can you reconcile this?  Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally. I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse ""blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks"" literally.  The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way.    >> Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.

And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be  able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.

People sometimes disagree about what is true. This does not negate  >> the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.    I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience. I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite. Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.   I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which God is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell. Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as  well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on  how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch?  No.    This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true, wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.  NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.        There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.        Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.        Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,        and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.        Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few         adults respond to this treatment.

Just maybe you won't be home.  Then you can come home to something  like this:      ""Well, it's been a rough month,"" begins Johnnie Lawmaster.  ""I  just get laid off, and my divorce became final.  But I just wasn't  ready for what happened this particular Monday.""      That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the  Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local  law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew  the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak  afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.      ""'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me.  'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house,  kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't  believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare.""      It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting  on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty  agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up  with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to  search for a ""Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial  number.""  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also  authorized agents to seize ""any tools used in the alteration or  modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers,  books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants  or owners of the property to be searched....""      Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force  operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital  involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against  Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons  drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the  front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw  personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the  floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins;  stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table  in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not  latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.      ""My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted  through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and  stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns,  the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my  magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking  around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to  turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down.  Then I found the note.  ""Nothing Found - ATF.""      ""They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa  all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they  can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then  come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to  watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain  what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide  open and left.""      Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  ""I asked,  'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, ""Who is  going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, ""If you're going  to talk to me, come down to my office.'      ""'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had  been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have  lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms  owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn  around.""      Lawmaster said the agent advised him, ""If you want your door to  lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it  yourself.""      ""'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come  down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring  your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'""   So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, make sure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.   > It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going > to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up > with a charismatic nutcase.

The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism  becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the issues with the resurrection.  randy  [I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically because they believed in resurrection.  However the beliefs that did cause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus. Of course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other than a great conspiracy.  The most common theory among non-Christians scholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event -- in effect, a delusion.  --clh] ",soc.religion.christian

"  We need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place in Tel-Aviv university. We have two databases that we are currently working on, but we would like to work on more databases, possibly more complicated  and ones that will give prettier images.  Before I describe what kind of data we need, let me mention that we are  going to present a paper titled ""Photo-Realistic Imaging of Digital Terrains"" which describes the research and the results, in the EUROGRAPHICS'93  conference in Barcelona, this september. We are going to show a video-tape  with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be  presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator.  We are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs,  and terrain elevation maps (DTM).  Each database consists of a 2D array of height values (any data format can be used for each value), and a corresponding 2D array of color values (can be gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit R/G/B values. Other format can also be used). We work on 512X512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases.  If anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get such data files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email us directly :  amit@math.tau.ac.il    (Amit Shaked), or danny@indigo.bgu.ac.il (Daniel Cohen)  Of course, the names of the people who will help us get the data will be cited in our paper, and in further publications.

You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the Clipper announcement is because of a silly mistake.  I am the administrator of csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out the needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which  includes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and other places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normally disabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of incident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several months ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old story, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't remember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to find out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted here, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with  Clipper.  I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here because csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account called 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory Board, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography, security, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information first-hand.  The 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is  not a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial traffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.  While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this, I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives of the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them for what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common practice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it again was unintentional.  -John Wack    ",sci.crypt

Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's ""sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.""  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of ""as a man thinketh, so he is.""  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.

"  	I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is, I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mV bias. 	The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series. With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of a pain in  the ass. 	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd like to have this box not be active. 	Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it.

It would have    to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to    ""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching    by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at    least it was a good try...  So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances? Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models.  A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this paper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject line    get 9304001   Here is the abstract of that paper.     The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them    at cosmological distances;    but as long as there is no distance    indicator to these events all possible sources which are    isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is    why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,    although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs    from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs    originate in the solar cometary cloud    cannot be excluded until it is disproved.     We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE    catalogue up to March, 1992), and    the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to    investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations    between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia,    assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,    at least to some extent, true variations    in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\vov$    test to both distributions.     We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov    test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a    $\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D    cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for    isolating the effect of possible observational biases.    These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but    the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any    connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations    which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\sim 800$    it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.    Currently,     it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement    found for the $\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort    cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \GRBs.

It seems to me that you are mis-using physical intuition here.  My point is that you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomena inappropriately.  Remember that there is no such thing as a ""global"" frame of reference for time.  Our minds like to pretend that there is, and we  imagine things like the calendar on Alpha Centaury being approx. 4 years off  from ours on Earth. This is simply wrong.  There is NO global ""time"" which can be applied to events on Alpha Centaury concurrently with events on Earth.  This is what Special Relativity has taught us.  If I am travelling past the Earth at a high rate of speed toward A.C. I can even have a different view of the  _order_ of the occurance of events on A.C. versus Earth.  Thus, the answer to  the question, ""what's happening on Alpha Centaury NOW?"" is NOT well-defined, if asked on Earth, until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relative velocities and the like; AND it will have different answers for different  values of these parameters. Now, in the vicinity of a black hole, the curvature of spacetime becomes  important enough that this lack of a global frame of reference becomes  very important.  In particular, the frame used by a distant observer is quite  different from the frame appropriate to the falling object.  Our minds just  don't seem able to easily deal with the idea that time itself could be  behaving differently in these two locations, but the equations of relativity  say that it does.  We would _like_ to say ""the falling object is hovering above the horizon, NOW"", for an object whose frame has rotated wholly ""away"" from ours.  In a very real sense, once the object has fallen into the hole its gone forever from our ken.

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order:     Try to find an exact match read-only color cell.

This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and  no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has  already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens  of read-only cells already in the colormap.

If you can't wait, then you can ftp a 6 months old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but this version is probably a lot slower than the final product.

Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   ""program"" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the ""auto selection tool""   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.  ImageStudio: Don't know...    Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100  Dapple Systems --------------   ""High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to   work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of   global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.""    Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by ""painting"" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator ""paint"" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in   the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching   tool and it is very good for this purpose.""    ""Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its   development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of   other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt   language for writing ""programs"" for processing an image, defining   convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down   menus etc... It is unprotected software.""    Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales,   Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.  Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: ""Laplacian, medium noise filter"", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber   software.   MIRAGE ------   It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the   Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.   It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image   processing displaying functions built in.   DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ----------------------------   The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book   containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is   compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.   Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.  MAXEN386 --------   A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does   maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital   Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is   mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92   (an article on CCD's vs film).   JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA) ------------------------   Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific.    Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640,   (800) 874-1888.  Microbrian ----------   Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card   (Vista), or an about to be released version will support a number of   super VGA cards.  Its a full blown remote sensed data processing   system.. It is menu driven (character based screen), but is does not use   a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle.   Mbrian = micro Barrier reef Image Anaysis System.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - ""AIPS++"" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.   LABOimage ---------   (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently   runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Supports 24-bit display""  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

" NASA Headquarters distributed the following press release today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""  NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East- West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.  ",sci.space

Somebody correct (flame) me please!  I *cannot* *believe* I am posting in this thread, but what the hell, he asked for it.  I had sort of the same reaction myself when I was first realizing I was bi.  ""So what, >90% of everyone else is straight, I'd never end up with a guy anyway.""  As several people on soc.bi pointed out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships or just for sex) in primarily straight circles.  Nowadays with gay culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so choose.  (About half my friends are bi, and that's just from hanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a week, it's not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in bars or something.)  So the available pool for dates can be the same size.  Unless of course you're trying to date a random sample of the US population.  As for promiscuity, I've traded email with Clayton on the topic, and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship. Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've *all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to be more sex.  Or that what's ""dysfunctional"", what's ""screwed up"" is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what  encourages deviant behavior in gay males.  (also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners  doesn't mean they're promiscuous.  yes, it sounds ridiculous, but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships, and be monogamous or nearly so...)   --                                                                       ____ Alan Jaffray (jaffray@math.uchicago.edu)  Email, 'talk' always welcome.  \bi/ Those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music -- Anon   \/ B0H7f-t+w-cg+(+)k+?s-vm-h-pS6/3bgz-++o-x-v+j+N0178l--+a(+)f-vn-(++)e--+dvb+u+ ",talk.politics.misc

Well, I agree that if you're going to stand in front of the net, that you should expect to get hit and hacked at. In general, you should expect to finish the game with some bruises. However, there is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain and discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another player. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That two hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of respect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He did not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he slashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a Leaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I was very disappointed.  You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least in his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and for that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd hate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like him very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but intentional) use of the stick.  Gary   ",rec.sport.hockey

I am a Leaf supporter and I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits Pat Burns.  If you were Pat Burns what would you do?  Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage to pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic idea...  Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against  the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples skin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole. He used to be good at it.  We need him now.    Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line. I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night. These guys are the ""swing"" players for the Wings.  Last year they did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.   Score Gilmour score!  Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-?? 	      Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line 	      Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)  * as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up 		 and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However, 		if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their 		checking line against these ""finesse"" players - well then 		let them play.  ** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in. ** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either. ** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).  I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and out-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending or officiating.  This calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next Monday.   -jake.   GO LEAFS !!!    ",rec.sport.hockey

This is not simply my opinion; even the Arab sources that I use do not make this claim. This, of course, is assuming that the NY Times was refering to the islands that I named above.

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.    The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given in ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window is popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event.  At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.  If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it there.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the same.)  The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5 public fix 20.

"Nntp-Posting-Host: hertz.njit.edu  Jim and Andy both have it incorrect I believe:  The *facts* are what is there, the processes that exist in the present or the physical evidence of the processes having occured in the past. These *facts* exist with or without a theory.  The *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both coherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions.  The *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation, relativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain how they interact... or even why.  A theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported* by the *facts*. A theory is a mental construct, a speculation,  a model.  If it is a good model, it may be useful.  In science a theory is something that is supported by the  evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence. A *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not yet enough evidence to support it.  When a new hypothesis  is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain *all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or predict new facts.

It *does* >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and >which are not.)  To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  ""You people call THIS science?""   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)    Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is  ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.     My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.  Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later  mathematicians did prove them, of course.)    I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a  matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of  incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to  objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step  of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward  that goal then one is not doing science.)  When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation.    In article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote:  > Namely, is there really justification for the belief that > science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?    Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable amount of effort in a ""serious scholarly investigation"" such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately  specific question to try and answer.    The ""science"" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science  currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.   I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use  of ""reason and observation.""  One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.    Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there  is any existing research related to this question.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.     lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet ",sci.med

" I have been backing up my hard drive ever since I had to re-install everything from scratch after a crash (learned the hard way, didn't I?!).

Is this >trend continuning?  This is not a trend. The Caps were done. Goneso in five games, and it saves us Caps fans a lot of pain.  I mean, it would be more painful if the Caps were up 3-1, watching them  tumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series. How many times have they done that in their history?  1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight 1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight 1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straight  In other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they  were a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being   1) a sweep of Philly in 1984 2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME  they managed to get out of the division.  Actually, Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Caps are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples:  1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1, gave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the last minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot. Series tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.  2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd  period, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games.  3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period. Blew it and the series.  4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it.  5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period. Blew it again.  When they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: ""if they blew this lead, the series is OVER"". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders believe they can come back no matter what the score is.  I am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can  completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear  lives in a crucial game.  >The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan. >P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh! Well, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps were frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking ""wait until Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire"". Well, they retired (even though Trottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet another generation of Islanders were still doing the same thing. Well, I guess  it has nothing to do with the players.  --                                            Edward Lor                                           lor@cbnewsk.att.com                                            ",rec.sport.hockey

Anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality deals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there is no proof for this.)  If the Law reveals the character of God, and  is ""holy, just, and good"" as is written in the New Testament, then those who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts to be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture.    Why must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual human adult relationships?  Isn't that bordering on sophistry?  The point we are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts. Not everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotional argument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors. The issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly.    I do not have problem with a loving, nonlustful relationship with a member of the same sex.  I have them, and we all do.  The issue at hand is  the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after. So other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation.   And the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationships between adult humans is red herring.  We all agree that it is okay  for adults to  have caring relationships with one another.

"  GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.   (Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the replies, if any, will be med-related.)

They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops, that is not a recognized ""illness"" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as ""Field Marshalls"".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the ""dark-side"" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)  Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.   >Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  >no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that  >balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...

Of course, I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.   >...Humans have all  >kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small  >and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.

A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  >happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.  In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.   >Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals  >and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  >vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  >Elaine's doctor a quack.  I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.   >survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  >the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In   Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida ""blooms"" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.   >some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  >membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  >the candida or not isn't certain.  My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, ""Sinus Survival"", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.   >If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  >nondescript.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast ""bloom"" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  It's a real Catch-22.  Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...   >Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  >the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  >vaginal tract which compete with it for food.

Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?   >While diabetics can suffer from a candida ""bloom"" the  most common cause of  >this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  >knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  >competition for candida as far as food is concerned.

Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (""roots"") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract ""candidiasis"".  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida ""bloom"" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming ""systemic"" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.   >In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  >reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  >favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  >humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.

When I finally find a  >doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to ""live with it"".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total ""cure"".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)   >...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  >GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  >patients is a non-existent syndrome.  Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said ""you'll just have to live with it"".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- ""yeast hypothesis"" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, ""it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases"", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the ""hypothetical yeast overgrowth"" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with ""scientific correctness"" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: ""well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.""  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).  I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.   >If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

" OK,      I saw a bike today and I want to know what it is.  Lets begin by saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally, it had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, at first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing), but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally, the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like  900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for the rear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)  So, what did I see?

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  [cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]  R. Scroggs       Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a ""Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology.""  The term is derived from Lev 18""22 & 20:13 where the LXX juxtaposes the two words arsenos (""male"") and koiten (""bed""), and represents the Hebrew miskab zabar (""lying with a male"").   Yet he believes that Paul did not originate the term, but borrowed it from ""circles of Hellenistic Jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions"" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid ""contact with the usual Greek terminology"" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs observes, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to native-speaking Greeks (108).       Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's ""learned discussion"" (107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of ""one who lies with a male"" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9), which Scroggs interprets as ""the effeminate call-boy,"" arsenokoitai is the active partner ""who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires"" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic model of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he affirms (109).      This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The combination of pornoi (""fornicators""), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (""slave dealers"") refers to ""male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave dealers [who procure them]"" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of pederasty ""which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes, and the use of these boys by adult males"" (121).  Even ""serious minded pagan authors"" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1.  Consequently Paul ""Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind"" (122). We cannot know what Paul would have said about the ""contemporary model of adult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships"" (122).       In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent.  He concludes that Paul ""does not care about any specific item in the lists"" (104).        Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a ""catalogue of vices,""  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are ""irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today"" (129).  The ""model in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the NT"" that ""Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination. . . "" (127).        REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI  D. Wright       In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have come under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's view is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out several shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults Boswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the ""Apostolic Constitutions,""  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28).  Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This is significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's claim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the gender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean ""a male who sleeps with a male,"" making arseno- the object.       Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the term, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it as an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity: ""No semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms"" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its object and where ""the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its gender"" (132).        It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright takes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources.  For example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis, androbaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite Hippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the Syriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to the Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34).        Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (""adultery""), porneia (""fornication""), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris (136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the Ten Commandments as ""You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (""you shall not commit adultery""), ou paidophthoreseis (""you shall not practice homosexuality with boys""), you shall not steal. . ."" (150 n. 43).       Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (""commit homosexuality"") exists in the Sibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was coined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by Or.Sib., book 2 (137-38).       Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew upon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John the Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.       Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be absent ""from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted (140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g. Didache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing Scripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41).        Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention (141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom, omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom 1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright observes that Boswell has ""signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity"" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world.        Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim and I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning ""homosexual"" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of the word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited conclusion based on them.       Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into being under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke ""generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides"" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).       In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and others who limit the term to ""active male prostitutes"" or pederasty are without significant support from linguistic and historical studies.    [Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we get into the ""good"" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will include ""Symposium"" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern understanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of Paul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of Lev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done away with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the general.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our culture, should stick around for this one.] ___________________________ 13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8.  Independently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is made in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from 146BC to AD 1100). 14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in Rom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P. Zaas, ""I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP 17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai were part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the vice list, ""and such were some of you,"" indicate that ""Paul is addressing real or potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by rote"" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry (147). 15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, ""Relations Natural and Unnatural""  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1,"" JRE 14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique. 16  D.F. Wright, ""Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I Cor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53. 17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, ""ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,"" effectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai.  He finds the meaning to be general, ""a male who has sex with a male"" (4-11).   18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers. 19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the references to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B. DeYoung, ""A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha,"" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53. 20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai points to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently ""why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia, and why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?""  (152 n. 71)  In a more recent article, ""Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,"" EvQ 61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a ""remarkable originality"" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).    ",soc.religion.christian

No reason?  How about these two:  1.  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along the 	corridors and set fire to it.  The speed at which the fire spread 	is not inconsistent with this claim.  2.  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound. 	There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start this 	fire.  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did.  3.  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide, it is very possible that 	David Koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that this 	was not suicide.  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.  There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction:  A.  They are not dead, but escaped via bunker,etc.  From reports of the 	inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found, I would rate this 	as highly unlikely.  B.  The fire was started by an FBI accident.  This is possible, but it would be 	foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it. 	Sure, it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern 	which started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle of 	the day near the edge of the complex?).  It's anecdotal evidence that 	has been contradicted by other escapees.  C.  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI.  This has been suggested by 	some on the NET, and I would rate this possibility as utterly 	ludicrous.  This is what we in ""sci.skeptic"" would call an 	""extraordinary claim"" and won't bother refuting unless someone gives 	any good evidence to back it up.  So we are left with two reasonable possibilities.  That the fire was an FBI accident and that the fire was started by the BD.  I find the latter more likely based on the evidence I've seen so far. --  *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)	*       ___ *					* _____/_o_\_____ *	Twinkle, twinkle, little .sig,	*(==(/_______\)==) *	Keep it less than 5 lines big.	* \==\/     \/==/ ",talk.religion.misc

I wonder why you say that?  I don't see why having a spouse and/or kids would have anything to do with it.  It might if you brought your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour (in which case I'd probably decide to take my kids to games on weekends, as many people do, or else be prepared to leave the game early), but from what you say later on, you don't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game. As it happens, I have a husband but no kids, and my husband usually attends games with me.  >Extra innings could put me >well past midnight.

As far as bagging work the next day, I don't really understand why that's necessary, unless going to a game also means that you consume vast quantities of beer (I note that this is the case for many guys).

Look: if I pay between $8.00 and $20.00 apiece for tickets, plus $10.00  for parking, plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston,  plus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark, then  I see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money. I can't afford to go to a lot of games.  Hence, going to a game is a big deal, like going to a play or an opera.  Maybe you have more money than  I do and can go to games all year long, so it's not such a big deal for you.   But I'm not interested in having games ""sped up"", any more than I want to have _Die Walkure_ cut down to a convenient ""weeknight version"" of two hours.

However, the rumors >I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter >seems more likely.  Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the ""External Tank"" and ""Wingless Orbiter"" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such as using the ""giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles,"" and building a ""station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.""  Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in today's Times).  Option ""A"" - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside, there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option are:   -  Uses ""Bus-1"", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's      qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C      Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force.   -  A ""Power Station Capability"" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle      flies in an ""arrow mode"" to optimize the microgravity environment.      Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions.   -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International      Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.   -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and      add another 20 kW of power   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,      the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return      Vehicle).  Option ""B"" - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option ""B"" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option ""A""). Also, the  number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit, for both options ""A"" and ""B"".  The build-up occurs in six phases:   -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when      it visits.   -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist      language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is      deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by      keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the      second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).   -  A ""Two Fault Tolerance Capability"" is achieved after 14 flights,      with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal      control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.   -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,      the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option,  with the exception of the data management system, which has major changes.  Option C - Single Core Launch Station. This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter cylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on the backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a  regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket motors, and launch the can. Some key features are:   - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout   - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels   - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against     micrometeroid & orbital debris)   - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)   - 7 berthing ports   - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet     (twice the volume of skylab).   - 7 floors, center passageway between floors   - 10 kW of housekeeping power   - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal     loops, dual environmental control & life support system)   - increased crew time for utilization   - 1 micro-g thru out the core module ",sci.space

Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for ""high ground"" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.

NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP:  ==========================  soc.religion.taize (Unmoderated)   PURPOSE OF THE GROUP:  ====================  The Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks  based in France. Many young adults come there to search for meaning in  their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a  sharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a  monthly ""Johannine Hour"" which will be posted at the beginning of each  month. A ""Johannine hour"" involves a short commentary on a given Bible  passage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that  may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be  posted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less  in polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another  to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own  life-journey.  The idea of ""Johannine hours"" was born in Taize as a simple response to all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in the midst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence, we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of Christ.  During the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we  understand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions,  we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to  communicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening  them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought  us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.  Perhaps those who read and think about the ""Johannine Hours"" in this newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.  The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the personal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect of sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.  BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY: =================================  The following provides some background information on the life and vocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.  ""A PARABLE OF COMMUNION"": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of World War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost abandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring together a monastic community which would live out ""a parable of community"", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of the time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal refugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.  AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize's founder spent the first two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949, seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and celibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation. Today, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant backgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North and South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for themselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no capital. The brothers earn their living and share with others entirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an international Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live in the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming people in Taize.  TAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and less young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since 1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have thus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental meetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any one week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner life and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to 6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church of Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too small.  ""A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH"" The community has never wanted to create a ""movement"" around itself. Instead, people are called to commit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood, their city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created what it calls ""a pilgrimage of trust on earth"". At the end of each year, the pilgrimage has a ""European meeting"" which brings together tens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for several days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia and in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open letter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the poor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages and provide themes for reflexion for the following year.

You can dream whatever you wish. We have demands from the Armenians. With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over all our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or recognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it. By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish  people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected  to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate  the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child.  Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To  assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings  was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom  free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.  If you have the stomach, I would strongly recommend the following references on the Armenian genocide of the Muslims.

But to add to this explaniation, each individual detector also has a built in fail-safe, just so the detector does not read the background radiation(i.e. cosmic rays),  if I remember right, the detectors go off about 3 to 5 sigma above the  background.

"   Misinterpretation, though it should be a crime in itself, is what United States lawyers use to make their bread and butter.    In Manchester, CT a few years ago, a small company wanted to run a game system galled ""LaserGames,"" similar in many aspects to Photon (tm). Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law in Manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. Among these things was ""shooting galleries,"" which is what the lawyers for the opposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon. The judge took the two words from this law, completely out of context, and ruled that LaserGames could not operate in Manchester.    Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in their shooting galleries, and not light beams. Clearly from context, LaserGames got shafted, but if the two words are applied, their denial of operating permission was justified.    If I had the text of the law I'd post it, but I'm afraid I don't remember it all well enough to even try. That little bit with the two words stuck well, though.  :	John Dormer :	jad@expert.cc.purdue.edu  ",sci.crypt

" Unable to stand the pain anymore, my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter and Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT.  It came with no instructions, but it came 2 weeks earlier than they said it would.  Installation would have been very easy, but the seat fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with the stock seat!  It never was easy to put on.  Once I figured that out, the new seat went on the first try.  The passenger backrest, though, does not fit as I thought it might.  The supplied screw to set the  backrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable,  hard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is a a soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back.  The driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortable enough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat without a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the  volume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it seems much more comfortable.  The backrest helps a bit, but I've not  has enough time to really test it.  The backrest also comes with a  small pocket.  Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the  10"" taller seat.  If I go on the three-notch ride soon ( Dixville, Pinkham & Smugglers), I'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like an improvement. --  	 Frank Evan Perdicaro 				Xyvision Color Systems       Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.		101 Edgewater Drive    inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572				Wakefield MA outhouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572		018801285 ",rec.motorcycles

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool.  Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head  for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from  end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by  Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall  for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero  because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.  Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very  well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over  Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all  those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them. Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...   >Blaming Stewart is just an >excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst >goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal.

I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night.  The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic, Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.  >Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  >five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  >ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.

Leclair missed his opportunities, as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.  >Roy is paid big money to  >play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5, when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him for most of the season.  >Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let >the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this >article, if possible.  The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of ""Burnsian"" hockey to shut down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the  extra 2.  Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.  >I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't >think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) >in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in >regardless.  If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.  Yaska  ! yaska@eecg.toronto.edu !

Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs.  May I suggest getting your mitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED?  This unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit.  It will output nearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times.  (nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP.  I got mine for about 50 cents a piece, even though I had to buy 100 of them....)  	BTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 watts...honest, 6 WATTS.  I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company name.  The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power, mamamia, that's pretty hot.  They also have a 4 watt, a 2 watt and a 1 watt device in their line, and will sell small quan. to individuals. If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the pertinent info.  	Now, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida. Phone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328.  They seem like  nice people.  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices, so they might be able to help you out.  	I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying. The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you'd need to up your carrier signal concept to 58.8 KHz......  Duane  ",sci.electronics

I speculate, from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK-78, that the algorithm  is a classified cryptosystem, similar in application to DES but cleared by  the NSA for classified traffic, that has been in use for a number of years.   Myktotronx refers to it as ""Government Type II encryption"", which matches the  designation of one of the types of encryption available on STU-III phones,  and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called ""CIPHER2"".  This would make sense, since this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem  which can act as a ""pin-compatible"" substitute for DES.  Combined with a  tappable key exchange protocol, this would offer exactly what is claimed for  Clipper: secure encryption with access via a key escrow.  If this is fact the  case, it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself.  Now, I do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem; my knowledge  of classified cryptography isn't even fuzzy :), it's nonexistent.  However,  it would certainly have been the least-effort approach on the part of the  government: take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES  (and which is at least as secure), set up a key escrow scheme for law  enforcement, and promote it for public use.  This also fits with Mykotronx,  who's been around but almost invisible for years.  Has anyone else made this sort of connection, or am I just hallucinating pink  elephants here? :).

You believe that the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, should consider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which I believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute. _Boomer v.  Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party, Boomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by another party, the Atlantic Cement Company.  The facts supported Boomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his property, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop doing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to consider such issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage faced by the plaintiffs.  Those issues had nothing to do with the case before the court.  > Bill, if the government had stepped in and the EPA made a regulation > requiring multi-million dollar cement plants to be shut down because > of a smattering of cement dust, at a cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1, > you'd be up in arms.

Quite the contrary, I'd probably support the action, since it would be based on the same general doctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in _Boomer_: the idea that people's property rights should not be violated for reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer's property rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the hypothetical EPA ruling you've presented, it's the American people's collective property rights in a healthy physical environment.  What good is cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1 if you wind up with cement dust in your air?  *  *  *  *  *  >>> Your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant. >>> If the State of Massachusetts came up with a similar regulation, >>> you'd be up in arms and complaining about interference with >>> property rights, and Fifth Amendment violations.

Yes.  So what?  The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights of individuals, not the general interests of some nebulous society.  If society can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights, fine.  Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less cement plant.

Which ""one"" are you speaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights. Besides, Coase's Theorem only has real application in the never-never land of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some people are going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise ""irrational"" from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so.  I don't care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head, so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150 per head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't want any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.  *   *   *   *   *  >> And then you say: ""Everyone's property rights were protected; the >> plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were >> avoided.""

Why should we treat a nuisance > plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff?  We don't > require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation; > why in tort?  Last question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth Amendment.  As to your ""Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made whole, because the award of damages in involuntary"" claim, you're at least partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer).  In these cases, the ""sale"" has already taken place and is irreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and (b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases like _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented from happening at all) by order of the court.  In these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the potential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the parties themselves.  >> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the >> business of ensuring that ""unnecessary"" settlement costs are avoided? >> (If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were >> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.) > > Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive.  In cases like _Boomer_, they're simply a cost of doing business.  The fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose property rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant. There's nothing punitive or unjust about it.  >> (2) It is ""completely sensible"" only if you believe that the alleged >> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid >> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and >> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to >> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who >> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts. >> [wdstarr] > > Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire > set of possessions to wronged person?  Weren't you complaining about > excess punitive damages before?  Anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be required to buy the right to do so from the victim, in advance.  And the seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege.  No injustice, no punitive damages.  *   *   *   *   *  >>> You'd like Posner, Bill.  He's a libertarian. >> >>Really?

Bruce hits the main point simply -- as Russell Turpin does in more detail in his response.  *All* sources are, in modern historiography, to be used critically, which is simply to say that any claims deriving from them are subject to *specific* examination in the light of motives and other HUMAN considerations (as well as the physical background).  The critical method applies BOTH to the original document AND to the uses made of it by others (most emphatically *including* the historical researchers themselves.)  >wouldn't they be a better ""reporter"" than someone who heard about it second  >hand?  I guess isn't firsthand better than second hand.  I know, there is bias, >and winners writing history, but doesn't the principle of firsthand being best >still apply?  But given the critical principle, what evidence is there that we have ANYTHING at ALL from ""firsthand"" sources about Jesus?  Paul's letters are indeed firsthand evidence ABOUT PAUL and his interactions.  They are, as a result, the most historically solid books in the NT.  Paul's claims and descriptions about his conflicts with Jerusalem may not be ""wie es eigent- lich gewesen"" -- but they are most definitely the comments of a participant! In other words, we'd evaluate Paul's statements more or less as we would the testimony of a witness in court.  The gospels are another story altogether.  Luke is most assuredly NOT a firsthand witness.  He *claims* to have gathered material that is closer to the actual events -- but this is a conventional claim in ancient books and Luke in fact NEVER NAMES a witness or points to any one thing in his book(s) which derive from any source *we* can detect behind Luke.  John has a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloved disciple (who is NOT named.)  We are not bound to accept this claim (for a long time, some scholars rejected it outright), but even if we do, it makes the fourth gospel as we have it *at best* secondhand.  Neither Mark nor Matthew make any claims to be firsthand.  Later (much later) Christian tradition associates the first gosple with Matthew and a possible Aramaic proto-gospel, and associates Mark with Peter as having something like the same second-hand status of recounting Peter's preaching of the gospel.  Such traditional claims run into difficulties if we try to evaluate the actual data before us.  Luke and Matthew both appear to use (differently!) an anonymous and not otherwise attested collection of _logoi_ (words and deeds) of Jesus, as well as to be dependent on Mark.  This makes their testimony AT LEAST thirdhand.  All that said, historians DO attempt to glean whatever they can from the NT sources, and they are overwhelmingly the obvious and best sources for anything about the earliest Church.  They are also *extremely* important for the light they cast (however refracted through Christian biases) on the sectarian world of Judaism just before and around the time of the destruction of the 2nd Temple.  The problem of ""the historical Jesus"" is tricky, however.  There is a cycle of fashion on this (and we are now near a major ""high"" in people thinking they *can* discern [with historico-critical plausibility] some- thing about Jesus' life and opinions from the NT.  The difficulty here (which dominated thinking 50 years ago, and will probably return to favor in another generation :-)) was pointed out by Bultmann, after Schweitzer's treatment at the end of the previous high-point on the cycle -- simply BECAUSE all our sources have passed through AT LEAST one layer of quite anonymous shaping WITHIN the early Church, we have no easy and reliable way to distribute ANY part of the material between ""real"" history and the inventions of the Church.  There are few ""radical skeptics"" who think we have nothing of history in the gospels [though such a position can be maintained], but neither have we any tools that can distinguish ""shaping"" of real historical material by its communal use as opposed to ""invention."" -- Michael L.

It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users. 	Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's  just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs,  and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed  on CD-ROM.  Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August. 	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't scorn the concept.) 	Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be  released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out  til '96.

Just for the hell of it, let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what?

Goodness, wait 'til the washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise. 	3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not worth all this bloody hassle'  	Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there.  	The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:  	a) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XOR arrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built in to the plan? 	b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong encryption?   >But that's not really the issue.

Besides, who is this mysterious 'they' who's going to take away all our rights the instant we let our guard down? Congress? That gang of buffoons can't even balance their checkbooks. The FBI?

""There was no such thing as Palestinians"" (Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel, London Sunday  Times, 15 June 1969)  2. ""There is, however, a difficulty from which the Zionist  dares not avert his eyes, though he rarely likes to face it.  Palestine proper has already its inhabitants."" (Israel Zangwill, The Voice of Jerusalem, London 1920,  p.88)  3. ""When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be  able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged  cockroaches in a bottle."" (Raphael Eitan, Israeli Chief of Staff, New York Times, 14  April 1983)  4. ""[The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs."" (Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to  the Knesset, quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, 'Begin and the ""Beasts"", New  Statesman, 25 June 1982)  5. ""Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians]  and the removal of the poor must be carried out  discreetly and circumspectly"". (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press,  1960, I., p.88)  6. ""Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no  room for both people together in this country...The only  solution is a Palestine.....without Arabs. And there is no  other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to the  neighboring countries, to transfer all of them; not one  village, not one tribe, should be left."" (Joseph Weitz, Jewish National Fund, administrator  responsible for Zionist colonization. Davar, 29 September  1967).  7.""We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the  Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment  for it in the transit countries, while denying it any  employment in our own country"" (Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960,  I, p.88)  8. ""[Zionists]...looked for means...to cause the tens of  thousands of sulky Arabs who remained in the Galilee to  flee...I gathered all the Jewish muktars, who have contact  with Arabs in different villages and asked them to  whisper in the ears of some Arabs that a great Jewish  reinforcement has arrived in Galilee and that it is going  to burn all of the villages of the Huleh. They should  suggest to these Arabs, as their friends, to escape while  there is still time....The tactic reached its goal....wide  areas were cleaned.""  (Yig'al Alon, Sepher Ha Palmach, in Hebrew, II. p.268,  quoted in Khalidi, From Haven to Conquest, IPS, 1971).  10.

""We must do everything to ensure they [the  Palestinian refugees] never do return"" (David Ben Gurion, in his diary, 19 July 1948, quoted in  Michael Bar Zohar, Ben Gurion: The Armed Prophet,  Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.157)  12. ""The country was mostly an empty desert, with only  a few islands of Arab settlement"" (Shimon Peres, Minister of Defense, quoted in David's  Sling: The Arming of Israel, Weidenfeld and Nicholson,  1970, p.249)  13. ""All this story about the danger of extermination [of  Jews] has been blown up....to justify the annexation of  new Arab territories"" (Mordechai Bentov, Israeli Cabinet Minister, Al  Hamishmar, 14 April 1972)  14. ""Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can  disqualify terrorism as a means of combat"" (Yitzhak Shamir, Hehazit, Summer 1943 [Journal of the  LEHI, the Stern Gang], translated from the Israeli daily  Al-Hamishmar, 24 December 1987  14.

""I hope that the Jewish frontiers of Palestine will be  as great as Jewish energy for getting Palestine"" (Dr. Chaim Weizmann, first President of the State of  Israel, Excerpts from His Historic Statements, Writings  and Addresses, Jewish Agency for Palestine, 1952, p.48)  17. ""There is not a single Jewish village in this country  that has not been built on the site of an Arab village"" (Moshe Dayan, Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969...)  18. ""Some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000  Arabs in the event of a new war, and instruments have  been prepared"" (Aharon Yariv, former chief of Israeli military  intelligence, 1980, Inquiry, 8 December 1980)  19. ""If I was an Arab leader I would never make [peace]  with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their  country.""

"Message-ID: <1r2lsi$m4h@bigboote.WPI.EDU> NNTP-Posting-Host: rajeesh.wpi.edu  Is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly RBI's? This is the situation that brought the question up:  The Red Sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5-1.  The Mariners had the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the fielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.    Now, without a judgement call (and I don't think there is one), this is an RBI for the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be ""defensive indifference"", since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point.  (I know, I can think of several ""If the Mariners stole third and second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and maybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc... scenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when you're down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)  The point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn't get ""credit"" (an RBI) for utterly failing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not trade an out for one run.

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is engaged on a project to ""convert"" the souls of deceased persons of other religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into heaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be made up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and the story was quite detailed).

Reynolds"" <jpr1@lehigh.edu> Subject: When you're not using it, turn it off! Date: Mon, 22 Mar 1993 06:50:14 GMT  Research has shown that the majority of the time that the United States' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on, they are not actively being used.  In addition, 30 to 40 percent are left running at night and on weekends.  Computer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use of electricity.  Computers alone are believed to account for five percent of commercial electricity consumption, and may account for ten percent by the year 2000.  If you are one of those who leave them on after you're done, it would be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF when you're not using it.  It only takes a second or two to do.  Also, the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed by the computer itself, but by the monitor.  If you can't turn the computer off, then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy- efficient PCs that ""power down"" automatically when not being used and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation.  These new computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and New Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual electricity bills.  Look for the special EPA ""Energy Star"" logo when you buy computers.  They should be available in one to two years.  According to the EPA studies, the energy saved will prevent CO2 emissions of 20 million tons annually, the equivalent of five million automobiles.  Also, 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions will be saved; these are the major pollutants responsible for acid rain.  Please do your part ... be responsible.  If you're not using it, then just TURN IT OFF.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Information herein is partially taken from the 1993 ""Information Please"" Almanac, page 573, and the U.S. Envirnomental Protection Agency's ""Environmental News.""

It would be nice to know that they were not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the  U.S. government.  Trusting the fox to guard the chickens, and all that. Seems suspicious when the rest of the sources are foxes.  While we are at it, the chip design(s) should be examined and verified against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon, regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm.  It would be a  shame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip, when all I'd know is that someone rang, and when I attempted to go off hook the line went dead.  Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect directly to a modem.  The design examination should be done to the gate level.  Does anyone have a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon?  The model would be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function.  Tip offs would be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence is not right.  I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used, and its possible that might be noticed, but could be edited from the netlist. I think the silicon itself needs to be investigated.  Imagine a design done in two layer metalization, yet finding a third layer under the microscope.    The government is asking for a lot of blind trust:  the encryption algorithm,  operating protocols, the agency having physical control of the devices, the  silicon implementation.  I'd feel like keeping one hand on my wallet.    ",sci.crypt

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...) 	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda's bursters. 	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is ""the edge of the Universe"" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.  	If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline  search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since  commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or  bulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative. This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are  recommended rather than yogurt.  I guess the next question is why would this introduction of ""good"" bacteria  back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the  anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy denys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a  facultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and  colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain  the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion  was stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the  intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida  looses it's major food source.  Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is  normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal  yeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has  been used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in  the medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting  their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their  patients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if  ever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age  emerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the  medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to  help patients or does it look the other way.  This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous  therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But  there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty  hot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only  well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or  do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to  work yet?  My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they  involve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into  the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other  is getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a  problem with recurring yeast infections.  Marty B. ",sci.med

Does anyone know anything about this problem........  - I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded   text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.   The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting   truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables   LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,   the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything   works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.   (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual    application, just in my sample code to make things easier) 	 - I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up   to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do      XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources   are set to japanese fonts.  - Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially   created with UIL.    The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)  I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the source to look at it is just a guess.

His problem is a tax program which requires a 17 cpi font to  print the forms properly.  This unit came to market in 2 versions.  The plus version supported  dowloadable fonts.  You can guess which one my friend has - the plain, not  the plus.  The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction  of cartridges including a 16.6 cpi - but none with a 17 cpi font.  Can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a 17 (or 18?) cpi font?   Alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable  cost?  Any suggestions would be welcome.

The problem is that I generally expect better from the FBI than from the BATF.  Unfortunately, the FBI seems so desparate to deflect ANY criticism of themselves that they are grasping at ANY straw, no matter how thin.

We ran into one of my relatives at the  bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away, near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, ""What are you standing here for? Go home immediately!"" I asked, ""What's going on?"" He says,  ""What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're  killing Armenians!"" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.  We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our  courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were  about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice  or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35. They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and  throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one  has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a  guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.  We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School  No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families  there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only  known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani  guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was  nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We  were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our  microdistrict.  We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.  On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of  them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I asked him for assistance. I say, ""We're in School No. 33, we need to be  evacuated."" Well he says, ""Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.""  I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with him personally. When I called he said, ""Muslimzade here.""  About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, ""Armenians, come  out, we're here to get you."" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in  their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, ""Where should I go?"" I  say, ""If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that  the Armenians were here and that they left."" That's what he did. He went down  there and said, ""The Armenians were here,"" he said, ""I let them out the back  door, they went that way."" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and  noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.  So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that  we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the  morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.  In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers  took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there  were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy,  about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor,  nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his  mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...  I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping,  with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of  them.  There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten,  everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage  was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to  get the things any cheaper.  I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we  worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw  me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his  feelings, of course.

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies.]    ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the   1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'   their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object   was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its   surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner   structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found   too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead   and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones   were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in   highly variable colour patterns.    High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in   the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up   seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at   Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and   others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.    Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's   fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on   healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers   but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and   spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose   diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that   in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person   isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to   foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.    But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is   the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from   which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the   leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely   important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'   the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing   about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern   can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would   vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid   contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than   the actual object itself.    [...]    Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer   has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...   From the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, ""Reality shopping; a consumer's guide to new age hokum."", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986, vNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples of hokum.]    The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of   study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal   movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for   instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will   emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and   hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that   the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian   photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.   Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings   in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The   variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on   the surface of the body and not to mysterious ""auras"" or even   necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,   television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous   parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of   the unknown.  --  Peter Kaminski kaminski@netcom.com ",sci.med

" (2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered)  Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles ""regular"" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a ""proper"" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow ""tickle"" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.  What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior? ",comp.windows.x

At this point,  many congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However, for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science, Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long record of support and interest in space development, and helped pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements Act.                               There is a small group of activists in southern California  who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns. We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting America back to the Moon.         Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert  for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late spring, 1993.         All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's office. As more is known, it will be passed on.         However, even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist: either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we, by necessity, must choose.                             This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources  Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson's staff review a bill.         If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians.         If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please request a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service address), or contact your local chapter of the National Space Society).  --- Maximus 2.01wb ",sci.space

So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on its side horizontally?

Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.

"  From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2:      Male sex survey: Gay activity low      A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough     examination of American men's sexual practices published since     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.      The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than     the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are. --  Clayton E.

I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word ""create"" is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.  > >     Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created >     and eternally existent are equivalent, you say ""granted the Mormon >     belief...""

This however, contradicts what the Bible >     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God: >    It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being ""offspring"" of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually ""born again"" of Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a word is dangerous.   >     This is really a red herring.

On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say that one must simply ""look at the Bible"" to see what it teaches, but centuries of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says.

Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.

On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great* importance.  The fact is that they are not.

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  Pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup.  I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as I'm sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us.  Now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist.  That would normally be a non-issue with me, but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which I guess it is, according to his faith).  This is a great strain to our friendship.  I would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended because I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so.'  So my question is, how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship?  How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he won't try?

I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called 8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression from the cpu to the AM29000 on the card.

Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to 	develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise 	probably become illegal pretty quickly here...  It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.  You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream.  With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work.  Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.  At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software (which I don't).  The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip. Economics, I'm afraid.  However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha) and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]  G ",sci.crypt

He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of response to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.  I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote out of context.    I asked Jim the following: >}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for >}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a >}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?

Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.  Does ""silence is concurrence"" imply that Jim thinks that because I didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.   But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next  gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion. Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help make it more clear, Jim), titled ""Inductive Logic"":  >Scenario: >A white goose waddles past the door >A white goose waddles past the door >A white goose waddles past the door >...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)... >A black goose waddles past the door.

Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I ""axed"" his articles, but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ... Well, I can't see where he is going with this.  But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80 articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)

Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted above the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take pictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bit digital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards, the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels, with 256 gray levels, on the screen.  Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camera is expected to cost between $150 and $250.  The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's Casper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have to purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.  The two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facility called the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.  The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support for up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an FPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will require a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards. Users will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the Cyclone's.  For more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek. ",comp.sys.mac.hardware

Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's where OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in.

"  I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an   Adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to   find out drive performance and these are the values I got  Seagate 106 Meg: 875.1kb/Sec	14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track  Quantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.  First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values   are.  What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the   IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not   be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on   which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap   file speed test program out there?  Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I   got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all   why I should load this driver?  Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.  -Eric ",comp.os.ms-windows.misc

Note the use of the word ""business"" in the above. The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only ""business"" use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys.  The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several of them would be a better idea than CLipper!  Them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so.  > A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has > been developed by government engineers.

The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again.                   > A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the > ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding > Americans.                > A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the > ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding > Americans.  Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word ""ensure"". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you. So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions, the answer in this press release is, YES.  > ...Each device containing the chip will have two unique > ""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government > agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.

The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the ""false assessment"". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant.

As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the ""innovations"" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return to the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.  I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in the Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just instituted the ""Tenebrae"" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for  a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things that I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those ""facts"" were always there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about the differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over breakfast Easter Sunday. > >   As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem >is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of >innovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any >decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to ""try >something new"" than it is to refuse to allow it.  My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music and worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee but listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a strong hand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong as it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional reason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual guidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA ""wishy-washy"".   As you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir- regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes the true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a traditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament of PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth. The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings are not shared by everyone.  I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want  them attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful service during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of Worship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such as the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it is Not there.  Quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and ""fit in"". My dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils would intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who have beared with me this far understand what I mean.  Please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not to worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something wrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or pastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to  provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.

If he makes astounding claims, which are not backed up with any evidence then he must be expected to substantiate them. If the original author had said that everything was his own opinion and not supportable then people would have simply ignored him.  He did not.  He claimed many things and his logic was seriously flawed.  His argument was for christianity in an effort to try to convince atheists like myself to believe him and his message.  I for one will not take things as read.  If you told me that pink fluffy elephants did the dance of the sugar plum fairy on the dark side of Jupiter then I would demand evidence!

From Captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict obedience to the Gensis command to subdue the earth, to Nazi's who have ""justly"" punished the Jews for the killing Christ (as well as the other progroms), the innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with ""you shall not allow a witch to live"", the Moslems who were killed in the Crusades, the god-fearing men destroyed by the inquistion.  The religious wars in Spain, France, England, etc.  Christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss of life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the instructions therein, was unquestionable.

It should be clear  from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only  to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim.  The argument against the messiah claim is not weak (maybe mine is, but in the hands of pros it is not).  There are indeed two passages.  The short one *cannot be used* to validate the messiah claim, imo.  That's why I refered to the long, which can be used.  It  flatly states Jesus ""was the Christ"", and mentions the crucifixion,  resurrection and Christian belief in said claims.  The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James' brother - ""... brother of Jesus, who *was called* the Christ, .... [emphasis mine]"", and that's it.  If original, Josephus has merely reported what some people say.  It is nothing  more than an observation, one which lacks the Christian fundamentals.  The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons: 1) its way out of context, 2) Origen evidently knew nothing of it, and 3) its rather inconsistent with the short.  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as  insert, and I see Jim agrees.  Consensus is usually reflected subtly, as in Elaine Pagel's _Gnostic Gospels_ (p. 85), ""A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ....[emphasis mine]"".  As for #2, I mentioned in my original post that  the long is a 3rd century insert (more properly, post-Origen as Jim notes).  There may not be consensus on the short.  The text, which discusses James in a legal role, stands with or without it.  That it does not upset context makes it difficult to argue insert.  On the other hand, an in-passing insert is easily disguised in any context.  Nonetheless, on historiographical grounds it is  worthless for the messiah defense, and that's why I didn't mention it.   I don't know about the Arabic ms.  If you have a translation reference, Jim, please let me know.  As for its ""much less gung-ho"" tone, obviously the date  of this ms. is critical.  If after ca. AD 700, a watered-down entry in lieu  of removal can be easily explained.  *<(:-)  Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota ",talk.religion.misc

We chose to believe whetever we want, but we are not allowed to define our own Christianity. we see in parts. If you see something that I do not see, or vice versa, it does not give me the right to play jokes on your belief!  There is no wonder that your ""miracle"" does not work. You designet it yourself, and even if you were able to collect a group of people like the one you describe, I see no reason why your ""miracle"" should really happen. God is the one who does miracles, not humans!  After all we are all on the same way, or at least, we are all headed for the same goal, following different paths. Remember that we are going to spend eternity together. If I can not stand your view here on earth, how can I possibly stand spending eternity together with you?  Tongues is a question of belief. Not wether you believe in Jesus, but if you believe that He is able to give you this gift. Just as any other of the gifts mentioned in the Bible. But there is no evidence in the Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way better than others.  > Perhaps I would believe the ""gifted ones"" more if they were > glorifying God rather than themselves. Then perhaps we'd > witness a real miracle.  Maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God, I don't know. But if this is the case, it still does not suggest that the gifts are faked.  In the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles. He said that ""I do nothing, except what my father tells me."" Perhaps it woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that example!

"Nntp-Posting-Host: acad3.alaska.edu  Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral exploration.  Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth.. You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.  There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends  of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made. BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe 600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks..   Basically to get back to my beginning statement, is space is the way to go cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the eco-freaks or the protectionist..

For instance, several plants in different cities each made one of six partial concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole formula.

"Distribution: world Message-ID: <1qlaap$rst@genesis.MCS.COM> NNTP-Posting-Host: localhost.mcs.com     The following was posted and no doubt retyped by Yigal Ahrens and considering   the importance of the issue and the almost total blackout except in   California, I am reposting to other appropriates groups.        From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.    EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer    SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the  Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a  nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than  950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as  12,000 people.    Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco  authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how  operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and  infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,  right-wing and what they called ""pinko"" organizations.    Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known  organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting  anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking  any laws.    Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to  gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los  Angeles and San Francisco.    Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political  spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan  Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish  Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of  directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San  Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.    People who were subjects of the spy operation included former  Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.  LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who  is based in South Africa.    Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was  confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement  agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and  organizations was sold separately to the South African government.    In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from  police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony  counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West  Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify  the search warrant.    The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than  25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.  Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in  San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax  attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not  be reached for comment, his office said.    Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a  panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial  recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a  former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.    The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied  repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.  League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an  employee and have said they simply traded information with police  departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.    But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,  San Francisco police alleged that ""ADL employees were apparently less  than truthful"" in providing information during an earlier search  conducted without a warrant.    David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said  the organization has not violated the law.  ""There is nothing  nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,"" he said.  ""Our  record speaks for itself.""    The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret  fund used to pay for ""fact-finding operations.""  Lehrer, according to  the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.  Patterson.    An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to  a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending  them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.    Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for  nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with  San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many  sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as  ""Skins"" and ""Pinkos,"" but that did not necessarily mean that they were  under surveillance.    ""I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,"" Bullock said.  ""And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a  threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,  say, 'Pinko.'""    In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police  Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he  was questioned by the FBI in the case.    A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records  and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,  vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license  photographs.    Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and  Bullock also provided information to the South African government,  receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.    The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the  South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss  nature of the spy operation.    The file notes that Kraft's articles ""appear frequently in The Times  and are well researched and written,"" but little else about the file  is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another  Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong  Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal  information.    Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how  Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from  skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash  of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his  own paid informants under code names such as ""Scott"" and ""Scumbag.""    He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,  exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,  including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.    It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying  on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African  government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an  agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the  probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The  Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather  information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,  Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and  investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league  offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of  San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax  Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to  cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los  Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that  some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may  have come from Los Angeles police officers.        From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.    ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.    SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a  civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities  who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential  police information on citizens and groups.    But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation  League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many  felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax  violations and conspiracy.    Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful  about its spying operations, which collected information on more than  12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political  spectrum.    Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show  that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept  files on political figures.    Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down  its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when  deciding what charges to file.    In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.  Foxman described the ADL as ""a Jewish defense agency which has fought  to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80  years.""    Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on  extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing  information to police, journalists, academics, government officials  and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain  information illegally, he said.    ""Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and  physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or  identity of any source of information,"" Foxman said.    The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its  longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than ""a private  individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'""    Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements  showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through  Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.    ""Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be  distanced from ADL,"" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.  Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.    Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate  with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn  over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's  offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.    A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,  produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial  transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it  will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.    ""The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,""  the district attorney said.  --  Yigal Arens  USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!  arens@isi.edu js  ",talk.politics.misc

EDT 	      	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.   	      	     Q	  Could we do this on the lawn? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out  to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President. 	      	     Q	  Is the stimulus package dead?  	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.   	      	     Q	  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You  said it was a good visit, but no compromise. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk  with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there  were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very  good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as  well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe  Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not  speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the  President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close  of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the  President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked  about that yesterday afternoon. 	      	     At the close of that discussion they said that they  would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator  was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific  compromises made on either side, they did say that they would  continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are. 	      	     Q	  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are  both making concessions? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that  phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said  consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.   He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to  take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to  make those adjustments. 	      	     Q	  On the subject of a VAT -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy. 	      	     Q	  Can we stay on this for one more minute? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure. 	      	     Q	  We have a problem with the five minutes -- 	      	     Q	  I know no decisions have been made, but what would  lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go  down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said  this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a  number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked  at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been  made. 	      	     Q	  To follow, have they done that directly through  him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President  about it? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although  there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the  VAT.  But the President has not made a decision. 	      	     Q	  At the meetings that he's had with his own task  force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the  possible options would be? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been  presented for a decision, no. 	      	     Q	  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an  option? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of  briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the  President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.   	      	     Q	  You're not saying he didn't know it was being  considered, though, are you? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered. 	      	     Q	  He knew that. 	      	     Q	  But has he discussed that with his advisers?   That's what I'm asking. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being  considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been  over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I  don't even know that it's -- 	      	     Q	  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at  this stage? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're  getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is  considered --  	      	     Q	  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed  it. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just  repeated.  	      	     Q	  George, is there any concern here that as a result  of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if  it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out  the way it did, that there may now be the development of a  credibility gap on this issue and others? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is  now public knowledge that this is being considered. 	      	     Q	  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute  statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it  was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it  come out not from you people, but -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out  from the administration.  What are you talking about? 	      	     Q	  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said  he would let us know.  	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right. 	      	     Q	  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that  it's not going to be on the program. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th. 	      	     Q	  On March 25th.  	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change. 	      	     Q	  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out  by rooting around in the fine print of an interview 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do  a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is -- (laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of  Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys  write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the  Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right  here, and AP story -- ""Clinton wants more money for spying."" 	      	     Q	  What about his remark that if it were being  considered, he'd tell us about it?   	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned,  and he'd let you know. 	      	     Q	  And did he? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say  this morning? 	      	     Q	  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of  me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of  Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his  administration.  That is his administration policy. 	      	     Q	  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they  orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they  answered the questions. 	      	     Q	  You're saying here that it didn't have to be  dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were  considering it. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.   Painfully clear. 	      	     Q	  Was there a particular political strategy in making  it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax  day? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being  considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they  answered that it was being considered. 	      	     Q	  George, The New York Times -- 	      	     Q	  Why do it yesterday? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked. 	      	     Q	  The New York Times reports today that Secretary  Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and  oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures  in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill,  but which turned out to be totally false. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally  false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor  Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they  say that.  	      	     Q	  The question is, is the President concerned about  behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he  doing about it, if so? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a  mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the  matter. 	      	     Q	  Isn't that the same information that goes to the  President? 	      	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of  information.  I think that's where the confusion was. 	      	     Q	  When did you all first learn about this mistake  that was made? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning. 	      	     Q	  And as far as you know, is the President aware of  it? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so. 	      	     Q	  And was he aware of it before he read about it in  The New York Times? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge. 	      	     Q	  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?   Anything? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't. 	      	     Q	  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on  this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both  statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that  mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said  it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again. 	      	     Q	  Did they drop it -- is this something that you  choose to spin or make an issue of? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of  work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to  get this jobs package going. 	      	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a  minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an  amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment  would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in  the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting  that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no  changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the  timing like that. 	      	     Q	  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer  this week than you were last week? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going  to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make  adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the  votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's  going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes  deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done. 	      	     Q	  Has there been any indication that this situation  has changed? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on  it.  We'll know when the votes are taken. 	      	     Q	  George, last week you said that there are -- or  various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go  through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because  he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the  compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could  accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've  realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted  to talk to the President about the stimulus package. 	      	     Q	  He initiated the conversation? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. 	      	     Q	  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact,  the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You  say he's making -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly  what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that  there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise,  and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President  doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get  it through, he will. 	      	     Q	  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was  working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before  the actual vote. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible. 	      	     Q	  Today? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will  happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward  with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come  forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it  passed. 	      	     Q	  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the  first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you  tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase  is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?   	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how  detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the  package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday  afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today  in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator  Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific  compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.   And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that  we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way. 	      	     Q	  What are the follow-up discussions if not the  President and Dole? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going  to talk to Senator Dole. 	      	     Q	  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.) 	      	     Q	  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right,  how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the  President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation  in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions. 	      	     Q	  Did they discuss actual numbers? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they  talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked  about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the  level of this many x-billion dollars.  	      	     Q	  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a  package? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not. 	      	     Q	  Did the White House have anything to do with the  protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole  was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no. 	      	     Q	  And has the President been in touch with Senators  Kohl or Feingold?   	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them,  no. 	      	     Q	  George, is the President considering the more  palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the  haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going  to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves  having to pay for the have-nots? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that  the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his  budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your  question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday. 	      	     Q	  George, on the subject of accuracy in information,  you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money  that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is  not true.  It's actually waste water money. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for  Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee.  	      	     Q	  But it would not affect the drinking water problem  because it's waste water money, right? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment  overall.  	      	     Q	  But the implication from your statement the other  day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.   Would you agree that's not the case? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I  know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin. 	      	     Q	  A leftover question from this morning, which was,  when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating  on a VAT? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just  don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between  the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.   	      	     Q	  So sometime since March 25th? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know  the exact date. 	      	     Q	  George, the President this morning mentioned that  some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the  National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax  being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel  that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed,  or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already  proposed?   	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to  say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is  being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.   The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that.  	      	     Q	  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't  be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the  income tax, for instance? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on  that. 	      	     Q	  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress,  Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you  think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it  have a chance? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea.  	      	     Q	  Is that a consideration whether you all put it  forward? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration  if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration  now. 	      	     Q	  You said at the beginning of the briefing that  circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under  consideration. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to  this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something  that has to be considered. 	      	     Q	  Those are the circumstances that have changed?   That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled  it out that groups have asked it to be considered? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said.  	      	     Q	  Is that true? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. 	      	     Q	  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin  taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the  deliberations. 	      	     Q	  But, George -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as  the President said, groups came forward and said this is something  you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it.  	      	     Q	  Is that the only thing that's changed since his  prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. 	      	     Q	  Can you explain how those groups -- how that  information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading  the newspaper or did groups make presentations? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know,  the health care task force has met with dozens of groups. 	      	     Q	  But this is the President's knowledge that these  groups had come forward. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what  was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been  published positions in the newspapers. 	      	     Q	  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's  presentations to them? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him  -- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the  working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these  groups. 	      	     Q	  What kind of arguments did the groups make that  were persuasive enough that the President would change the position  that he had enunciated previously? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had  longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance  health care. 	      	     Q	  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding  positions? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.   Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the  basic arguments for and against a VAT tax. 	      	     Q	  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're  telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this  change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February  and now -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't  necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision. 	      	     Q	  I know, but the President said that it was off the  table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's  changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also  describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.   If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been  made to the President -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the  presentations to the health care task force. 	      	     Q	  There's no relationship at all between the fact  that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he  favored will not produce enough revenue to finance -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested  that they would produce all the revenue. 	      	     Q	  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were  appropriate ways to finance health care. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that  he said anything to refute that. 	      	     Q	  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that  there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind  of core benefits -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task  force ever suggested that there would. 	      	     Q	  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break  his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his  programs? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical  situation. 	     	   	     Q	  But does that promise -- would that promise not to  raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him  from seeking a VAT tax? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions  on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the  implications then. 	      	     Q	  Which specific groups can you cite -- business,  labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task  force has prompted this consideration? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just  don't have that. 	      	     Q	  George, can you tell us to what extend these other  alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or  other financing options are also still on the table and what these  options are? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force  and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking  at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that  there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not  going to comment -- 	      	     Q	  What's the scope -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on  them, no. 	      	     Q	  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you  talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the  -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task  force is looking at. 	      	     Q	  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the  Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the  President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his  task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and  the remark about market access at the press conference? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note? 	      	     Q	  Does no mean yes. 	      	     Q	  Yes and no. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the  Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question  about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when  he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that  certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the  President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and  the U.S. that we want to do something about. 	      	     Q	  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he  suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in  terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?   	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state  our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit  very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your  characterization of the Prime Minister's comments. 	      	     Q	     that we need specific export targets, specific  numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with  Miyazawa? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad  discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into  those specifics until after the meeting. 	      	     Q	  Why? 	      	     Q	   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or  not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical  targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of  hopeless that this is going to change very much? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must  have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not  want to get into the specifics of how that would be done. 	      	     Q	  But does the President believe that their stimulus  package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants  to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister  Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it. 	      	     Q	  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to  be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary  Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do  more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to  work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to  press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I  think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and  we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral  packages. 	      	     Q	  Do you think the Japanese need to do more? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work  with all our allies to do as much as we can. 	      	     Q	  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today  Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on  the Bosnia policy.  And he said, ""It's a rather emotional response.""   	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue. 	      	     Q	  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White   House condone that kind of remark? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary  Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also  that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find  answers for.  	      	     Q	  But that specific -- ""rather emotional response"" --  specific term? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself. 	      	     Q	  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with  the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it  good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now  to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example? 	      	     Q	  To take stronger action, to take military action --  air strikes, anything that can be done? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what  must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as  you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms  embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase  pressure at this time. 	      	     Q	  What is your response to the critics who would say  that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain  the presidency? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard  for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard  for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the  arms embargo. 	      	     Q	  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen  getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said  that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that  change your thinking? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to  whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to  say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions  and talking about the arms embargo. 	      	     Q	  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She  said she would be able to provide some administration officials who  could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are  you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said. 	      	     Q	  That's exactly what she said. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But  what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of  evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are  connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and  we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have  an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute,  what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact  effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods  into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What  kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't  know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at  all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much. 	      	     Q	  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be  released? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.   And it will be probably later today. 	      	     Q	  Is the President considering signing an executive  order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work  force as part of the gay rights march here next week? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal  for that at this time, not that I know of. 	      	     Q	  It's something that the President promised during  the campaign that he would do. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't  think it's anything that's on his plate right now. 	      	     Q	  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point  on this issue? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.   I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian  community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of  different groups and communities. 	      	     Q	  Do you know if that's scheduled -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow. 	      	     Q	  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.) 	      	     Q	  It's a good thing you asked. 	      	     Q	  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.) 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know. 	      	     Q	  How long -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know. 	      	     Q	  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?   (Laughter.) 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I  don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow. 	      	     Q	  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major  speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but  I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to  give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not  exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like  that. 	      	     Q	  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of  the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific  timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under  discussion and something we've been working on. 	      	     Q	  Campaign finance reform? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it. 	      	     Q	  Do you think it will be next week? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure. 	      	     Q	  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working  on?  I missed the question. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.   He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know  anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working  on. 	      	     Q	  Do you know what organizations might be represented  in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't. 	      	     Q	  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out  of town on the day of the march? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate  meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a  speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston  on Sunday, as he did last year. 	      	     Q	  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you  on the question? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what? 	      	     Q	  On the gays. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the  President's schedule for the day, certainly. 	      	     Q?	    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is  that Sunday? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday. 	      	     Q	  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. 	      	     Q	  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one  day? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how  long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't  know. 	      	     Q	  You would have made the gay meeting public, right? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting  -- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you  about it. 	      	     Q	  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the  first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --    	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in  the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's  not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.) 	      	     Q	     at the White House in the Bush administration  gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White  House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make  sure -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do  anything like that. 	      	     Q	  Certainly not. 	      	     Q	  What marching orders did the President give to  General Vessey? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for  about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was  he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will  obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.   The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting  and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes  in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's  response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look  into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on  remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to  military archives.   	      	     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the  activities of the joint commission and on the document. 	      	     Q	  Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis  at this stage? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's  also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the  Vietnamese. 	      	     Q	  A number of Defense officials have been saying that  they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact,  non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to  as Americans from time to time.  Do people --  	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final  determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we  have it, we'll make a judgment. 	      	     Q	  I know you don't have any final determination, but  given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that  that's a likely possibility? 	      	     MR.

MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I  think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied  that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would  point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than  any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also -- 	      	     Q	  How many questions? 	      	     MR.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very  good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the  article also implied that these questions were only answered at  tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.   He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval  Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to  questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the -- 	      	     Q	  Oval Office press conference -- when was that?

And this is just to the White House, Washington  Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local  television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The  Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather.  He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and  Connecticut -- 	      	     Q	  Can you address the question of the attitude?

Q	  The story is that you -- are you held responsible  for it. 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment  about this. 	      	     Q	  Are you denying that the President has shown  displeasure publicly? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the  discussions between the President and myself. 	      	     Q	  Did the President write that letter to Chris  Webber? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What? 	      	     Q	  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball  player? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes. 	      	     Q	  That is an authentic letter? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. 	      	     Q	  Since the President first talked about the VAT in  February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should  be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.   Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a  proposal he hasn't made. 	      	     Q	  George, does the President have some agenda for  this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a  general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about  including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights. 	      	     Q	  The military issue? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up. 	      	     Q	  Is he using this event to name the AIDS -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so. 	      	     Q	  George, what specifically is the President doing to  prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had  general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the  Trade Representative and others. 	      	     Q	     report yet? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report  referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him  today. 	      	     Q	  He was? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. 	      	     Q	  Does he intend to use any of these instances that  -- 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the  report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press  hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred. 	      	     Q	  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was  that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he  feels that way? 	      	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the  record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again,  I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The  thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the  President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he  has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent  history.

It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by ""average"" people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty homogeonously Christian.  It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.  The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages critical thought.  >In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and >I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their >lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from >being trusted or righteous.

"Message-ID: <1rcqub$5f8@access.digex.net> NNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net Summary: Why the repeated leaks? Keywords: clutch master cyl problems  I have both an '84 and an '86 Camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions. The '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles.  ABout a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was         leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem licked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months later!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I didn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the problem.  I should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch.  My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal, the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the cylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.  What do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?  Now the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain why all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the passenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What can you suggest here?  Many thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...  Bill Christens-Barry cerulean@access.digex.com  ",rec.autos

Why are you holding >the ""Branch Davidian"" to a higher standard than the Jews?  Although I can understand why you think the comparison might be valid, I would have to disagree. The Jews who found themselves alone against Rome on Masada faced a future which was infinitely bleaker than the one faced by the Branch Davidians. The latter, in reality, would likely have been charged with weapons violations and other sorts of crimes. Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely. It is highly unlikely that anyone other than Vernon Howell would have been been imprisoned for very long. But regardless, most of the people, and certainly all of the children, would have been allowed to leave, and if they so chose, join another cult.  The Jews on Masada well understood their likely fate from what had already happened. Had they surrendered, the men of fighting age would probably have been put to death, perhaps crucified.  The women and children would have been enslaved. None of them would have been likely to practice their religion again.  I understand that Howell/Koresh and perhaps others will argue that the fate of the Branch Davidians was ""equally"" onerous and that they were fighting for religious freedom. I guest that's a judgement call...  --  ________________________________________ Jack F. Love	| 	Opinions expressed are mine alone. 		|	(Unless you happen to agree.) ",talk.politics.guns

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of lives.  I wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as choosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done, since they had not been born yet.  Clearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, ""Neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born.""  Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate Easau when Esau has done nothing bad?  I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when what is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example, consider the saying in Matthew 6:24   + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one  + and love the other, or....  Now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one of them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in second place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call simultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both. One must take second place. In our original example, second place means that Jacob, not Esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and obligation, and to be the ancestor of Christ.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew 11:14 which says of John the Baptist:   + And if ye will receive it, this is ELijah, who was to come.  I take this to mean that John was an Elijah-like figure, dressing and living like Elijah, preaching like Elijah, and fulfilling the prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah.  I do not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently, neither did he (John 1:21).   Yours,  James Kiefer ",soc.religion.christian

" Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a ""safe"" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments ""turned off"" rather than just ""safed"".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....    I've heard the argument that an active but ""uncontrolled"" spacecraft causes ""radio noise.""  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed ""safe"" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a ""pause"" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission ""drift"" phase.  So any holes in all this?   /~~~(-: James T.

Let us say a little The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything into practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've found that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they are just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this retreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only one area in which disciples stand out from ""Christians"".  Also, another part of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of some ""Christian"" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of conviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be unified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along together.  >The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches >(denominations) with the same characteristics. Both have the same >confessions; there are only some differences with respect to - for >example - the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to ""use"" >our creeds.

What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly better?  >So, here is a first question: >- can the congregation of Christ be separated by walls of different >  denominations? Or is this definitely an untolerable situation >  according to the Scriptures?  According to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going to be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion and belief.  However, Scripture states:      In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).  How will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but before that, there are these qualities:    devotion to the apostles teaching    fellowship    communion    filling with awe for God    all having everything in common.    glad and sincere hearts    praising God    enjoying the favor of the people All these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, ""a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit"" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts 7:54-60).    >- can one say that only one of these three churches is the >  true church of Jesus Christ?  One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I have yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston Church of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is totally sold out to God.  > >A problem closely related to these question is: >- can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches -  >  before there is a unity? This question is especially important >  for those who think that only one church can be the ""true one"". > As for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may never occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the ""true one"", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they will not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement. I know I haven't.  >Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you. >For your information: we have a lot of organizations here which >are founded by people of one specific church and whose members >are all members of that church. This has been considered as >""correct"" for years. Only a few years ago people started to >discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process. >Some organizations are opening their doors for people from >other churches etc. > I must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is something ""correct"" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of the churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being ""opened up"" so that they would have to step right back in. Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division within.  There's enough division without.  >Thanks for your opinions in advance! > >Maarten  Joe Fisher ",soc.religion.christian

" Jeff,   I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14"" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half a year and I love it.   Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only complaint was that they did not always return my calls.   I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's (800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.  -David  **** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

"    Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this ""Banner"" reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir.    The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the ""Environmental Billboard"".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the ""Environmental Billboard"" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.    To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ""ozone reading sensors"" to ""continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's delicate protective ozone layer,"" according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. According to IMI, ""as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer."" The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and ""adds to the ozone supply.""    This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost $600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    But back to Brian's questions: >And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN >news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the ""wild >idea"" stage or does it have real funding?        See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.     And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer, and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?)    (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)     As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.       And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least I don't THINK I do...).  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor  --- Maximus 2.01wb ",sci.space

I personally can't really asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI or BD) over intential setting of the fire).     I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds.  The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically denied that they've reach any such conclusions.  He pointed out that under intense heat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports I've read and heard.     In short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on Monday.  We should remain skeptical until more information is available.    |> --  |> *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)	*       ___ |> *					* _____/_o_\_____ |> *	Twinkle, twinkle, little .sig,	*(==(/_______\)==) |> *	Keep it less than 5 lines big.	* \==\/     \/==/  --   Bob Garwood ",talk.religion.misc

Glover >----------------  The Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that  the two sides have exchanged roles.  The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California, it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police now confiscate property, without trial, under a ""good faith probable cause"" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a majority will answer ""yes"" if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.  According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under the ""War on Drugs"" campaign of ""zero tolerance"" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political:  ""My fellow Americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder""--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different tastes in recreational drugs.  What goes around comes around.       Alan T.

The purpose of copy protection is to discourage casual pirates (""Oh, can I have a copy of that?""/""Sure, here."") and the less sophisticated pirates (""Let's look for all those calls to INT13H..."") .  Any one determined enough to break copy protection can and will succeed.  They can always backtrace the entire load-sequence of the program.  The point of copy protection is to make such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses (or to minimize such intrusion) of legitimate use.  Pirates who see copy protection as a challenge love breaking them, and no amount of copy protection will stop them, but the rest of us WILL be stopped.  How many of these hardcore pirates are there compared to rest of us?  Not that many.  --Kasey Chang ",sci.electronics

Needs attention to brake cylinders (like all MG-T's) but otherwise ready to run.  Chrome & paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent. The engine, a 1250cc, was completely overhauled by a machine shop.  It is priced at $12,000.  1953 MG-TD Good shape but hasn't been run since '70's.  Needs engine work, but no rust and everything is with it including a top, side curtains and carpet that were new and haven't seen the outdoors since the '70's. $9,500.  1952 MG-TD Basket Case.  I'd call it a parts car, but it's too good for that.  Everything seems to be there except the tach.  Would make a good project car or parts car if you insist.

I've admired both his paintings (remember the USPS Solar System Exploration Stamps last year?) and his writings on the history of spaceflight.  For several years he's been working on a *big* project which is almost ready to hit the streets.  A brochure from his publisher has landed in my mailbox, and I thought it was cool enough to type in part of it (it's rather long).  Especially given the Net's strong interest in vaporware spacecraft...                   ==================================                           The Dream Machines: An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature                              By Ron Miller                   with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke  Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne, Florida, USA Orig. Ed. 1993 Pre-publication $84.50 ISBN 0-89464-039-9   This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to reach them.     Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient, attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize differences, similarities, and influences.  This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history, and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship.  SPECIAL FEATURES  Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and fictional  Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA archives  An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

That (""complicated"") isn't in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; it's more the other way around. It's from    P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG')  where G' is the complement of G  and by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).  In a sense, HG is necessarily more ""complicated"" than H for any H and G, so I may be splitting hairs, but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG) holds, with equality if and only if P(HG') = 0.  > As you point out, it's a very simple matter to show P(x | H) = P(x | HG) > ==> P(H | x) > P(HG | x), and thus H is to be preferd to HG. Now to say > that H is as consistent with the data as HG is to say P(x | H) =  P(x | HG). > Can you elaborate some on this.  Well, ""P(x | A) = P(x | B)"" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference reduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior probabilities P(A) and P(B):    P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>      P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)  where k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).  So A and B are ""equally consistent with the data"" in that observing x doesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.  In the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don't know the actual values, and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG.  > Also, in the ""real world"" it isn't as clear cut and dry it seems  > to me. We can't always determine whether the equality ""P(x | H) =   > P(x | HG)"" is true.   That's certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or not a `divine component' actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word'.  Now it seems to me, as I've said, that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather *less* well if one proposes a `divine component' in addition, since I would expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn't even equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission, G is `divine component', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression.  > BTW, my beef with your Baysian argument was not a mathematical one -  > I checked most of your work and didn't find an error and you seem very   > careful so there probably isn't a ""math mistake"".

I'm not a Baysian statistician (nor any type of  > statistician), so this would be very helpful.   Not that I'm a statistician as such either, but:  The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the (read `my') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with which I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be answered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable to statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in measurable ways.  This means that these regions of the space of possible observations,  which I loosely termed ""appearances of god/s"", have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.  Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism expends on making ""appearances of god/s"" possible must come from somewhere else (i.e. other possible observations).  All else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn't* an ""appearance of god/s"" must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.  Sorry if that's still a bit jargonesque, but it's rather difficult to put it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total area under them is always unity.  An analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is ""the coin is fair"", and that B is ""the coin is unfair (two-headed)"". (I've used A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)  Then    P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1   P(T | A) = 0.5  }    P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1   P(T | B) = 0    }  The observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible with both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they don't actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must be unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads.  Say our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The observation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are modified according to                              P(H | A)   e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m                               P(H)  and                              P(H | B)   e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m                               P(H)  Now we don't know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but the multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed.  Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have                   n   e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)  and                     n   e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),  and since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1 and thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.  The loose analogy is between ""unfair coin"" and atheism, and between ""fair coin"" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which would falsify ""unfair coin"", is analogous to an ""appearance of god/s"", which would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle is the same.  >> Constant observation of no evidence for gods, if evidence for them  >                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >> is at all possible under the respective theisms, constantly increases >  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >> the notional estimated probability that they don't exist,   > It's important to draw a distinction between theism that could > be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can't. > Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible, > it doesn't make sense to say ""lack of evidence"" supports the contrary  > view.

We don't need, in the above analogy, to know *any* prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity. You don't need to know the initial values of the running estimates either. It's clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin) approaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.  All you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for observed x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible under Ha, and all else is equal.  > Baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations.

Any observations you like; it really doesn't matter, nor affect the reasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which would count as ""appearances of god/s"".

OK, we'll downgrade ""*does* interact"" to ""*may* interact"", which would actually be better since ""does interact"" implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced.  > I don't think my theism makes ""predictions"". Maybe I'm not > understanding what you mean by ""prediction"" - could you explain what > you mean by this word?  I'll explain, but bear in mind that this isn't central; all I require of a theism is that it *not* make the prediction ""Appearances of god/s will never happen"", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn't make this prediction either, the difference is that QM and atheism do not form a partition.)  Predictions include such statements as ""Prayer is efficacious"" (implying ""If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious""), or ""Prayer is *not* efficacious"", or ""Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled."" I don't think we have any problems of misunderstanding here.  >> Persistent observation of this stuff not happening, *consistent* with >> Ht though it may be, is *more* consistent with Ha, as explained in the >> Bayesian stats post.  >> >> Even if Ht (""God exists"") is unfalsifiable, that's >> no problem for my argument, other than that you have to let the number  >> of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically.   > BTW, I do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of  > observations as valid - or rather that part of the argument is not valid.  > We, as existing humans, can never make an infinite number of measurments  > and any conclusion that reilies on this I don't accept as valid.  That's fine; I don't claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite number of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and that as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.  > [Renormalization stuff deleted]  >> In the Bayesian stats post, I assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable >> in a finite number of observations.

No: by way of a counterexample, let X = ""the coin is fair"", or more accurately (so that not(X) makes sense) ""the two sides of the coin are different"". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable, and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.  >>> This is partly what's wrong with you Baysian argument - which  >>> requires observations x[1] ... x[n] to be made.

I conditionally retain this reference in regard to Khomeini's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the  so-called ""Twelve Imams,"" which is in clear conflict with the Qur'an  in that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example higher than that of the Muhammad, in that the Qur'an shows that the Prophet was clearly fallible, as well as (it appears, given your abstruse theological statment regarding the ""natures""  of the Twelve Imams) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the  remainder of humanity, with the possible exception of Muhammad,  something which verges on the sin of association.  >As salam a-laikum  Alaikum Wassalam,  Gregg  ",alt.atheism

A >  A >  Robert Allison   I tried to e-mail you, but our board is having internet problems,  so I'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not.    Rutin is NOT a herb, but part of the bioflavonoid complex. You should  generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid   complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)  you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other  major component of the bioflavonoid complex.  I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it  showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-  fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in   hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids   to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.  Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so  there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole  bioflavonoid complex instead.   I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that   they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose   bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...  One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day  for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.     They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can  be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are  made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.   About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency,   with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.  For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.    In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they  are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine   bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite  small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times  higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark  extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.  The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'

Reproduced without permission.]    Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors  Although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile,  Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle berry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids  (which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste sour as well.  Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such substances would taste sweet without providing many calories.  A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries. We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We  awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

" I found this press release from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice on another system, and thought it would be of interest on campuses  where the administration or the athletics department wants to  eliminate the women's ice hockey team.   Women Athletes, TLP Win Sex Discrimination Ruling: Brown University Ordered to Restore Two Women's Varsity Teams To: National Desk, Sports Writer  Contact: Lynette Labinger, 401-421-9794, home 401-274-7507, or           Ray Marcaccio, 401-831-8900, both of Trial Lawyers For           Public Justice     WASHINGTON, April 16 -- The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston has upheld a U.S. District Court order requiring Brown University to immediately reinstate its women's gymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status. The ruling in Cohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision in the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial Lawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interest law firm representing the women athletes.    ""This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a school wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of opportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams,"" said TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.    The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violating Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions receiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams as university-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to compete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for uniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also been denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.    ""This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,"" said TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney & Labinger.  ""Universities across America need to reevaluate their programs quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced.""    Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and Colgate University are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders requiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity teams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ is representing women athletes at IUP.    In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included: Ray Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca & Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  The National Women's Law Center, Women's Sports Foundation, and National Association for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in support of TLPJ's appeal.  -30- ",rec.sport.hockey

I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.  Rick. ",talk.politics.guns

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700 upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21"" with 8 bit depth and up to 16"" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.    If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're better off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an accelerator.  Paul ",comp.sys.mac.hardware

I suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority....  You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and  one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent  assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke.  'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in  using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population. (Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now,  but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage if anything is low.)  At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred  to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group  can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might  support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.  Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.    >	                               Besides, there are other >	means of self-protection which can be just as effective >	as firearms.

" Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  ""political science"" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how ""scientists"" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that ""nuclear winter"" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust ""scientists"" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's ""scientists""  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for ""global warming"".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of ""acid rain"", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   ""Ozone depletion"", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA ""discoveries"" on the  effect of ""secondhand smoking"" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document to them for high resolution printing or ripping.

"  I just received a music software WinSong for Windows and found that it needs a MIDI/sound card (Sound Blaster Pro is preferred) to have its fantastic features show up. As I don't have the plan to add a sound card now, I am  putting it here for sale. It's listed $79.95 on April issue of WINDOWS  magazine and I paid $84.95 as the total. I am asking around $70 with shipping included.  WinSong for Windows:  Composer, sequencer (tape deck), and Juke Box all in one.  It's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move and copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition.  It's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder. Up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward and stop.  It plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set, saxophone, clarinet, organ, and many.  You do not need to be a musician to use this software. The on-line manual is handy.

Like many politicians he cared      Less about ideals          than results      Less about ends          than means      Less about anything          than keeping his job               (and his head).  We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose      conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him,   See to it yourselves.''  But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar' His heart froze.  If he killed their madman     He'd start a riot          and lose his job              (and his head)  If he saved the King of the Jews     He'd piss off Caesar          and lose his job              (and his head)  And when his wife told him to have    Nothing to do with the righteous lout She didn't tell him anything    He hadn't already figured out.  So he punted.  ``Not my jurisdiction!  Take him to see Herod!'' (who just happened to be in town....)  Herod appreciated the courtesy But wasn't worried         And sent the sharp-tongued fool      (Who suddenly didn't have much to say,     funny how people lose it under pressure....)   back In the attire proper   to his Royal State.  His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem, Caesar certainly won't.  The fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it's not Caesar's.  ``I'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout. (Looks like he'll last this one out....)  The crowd's reaction puzzled him.   They really wanted him dead. They didn't want the King of the Jews,   They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we'll get Barabbas next time.  And if I can get them to say    ``We have no king but Caesar!''    By killing a madman, Hell, I'll kill ten a day.  And then Pilate had his fun   A little joke     Short       To the point         Trilingual  And all this Went as it always does When someone gets caught In the gears of government  And there's a scientific explanation      (no doubt) For the superstitious rumors      (persisting to this day) That it didn't all end With a tomb and a Roman squadron on guard.

" The Clipper chip is just the culmination of Dorthy Denning et all. But lets ignore that for the moment.  The fundamental question is:Can the government stop me from using encryption?  Ignoring for the moment the question of patented processes (such as Public Keys), can the government stop me from using an encryption process?  If the answer is yes then what freedom we have in this country is truly gone and its time to get out the guns or the lawyers (depending upon which causes more damage and to whom).  However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please, who cares about the clipper chip? As far as I'm concerned a phone line is insecure PERIOD. I don't care if they encrypt it 10 ways from sunday, if I didn't do the encrypting, I don't trust it. This is the attitude that everyone else should have. Instead of worrying about a clipper chip, simply connect your handset to your computer and feed the voice single through, process, encrypt, and transmit over the phone. The guy on the other hand then does the same in reverse.  Can't work you say? No Standard you say? Obviously you have never uses PGP.  Anyone who expects the government to protect their freedoms is kidding themselves. Only you can protect your own freedoms.

If not, why? 	3.What SPECIFIC actions are you planning to take to either 	support or stop this proposal? 	4.If you do not support this proposal, what alternatives do 	you offer?

Some >send data to both, some only send data to the left channel >(the first is preferrable, of course)  Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.  The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant ""I want to play a mono sound"" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: >Lemmings >Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW) >Glider 4.0 >OIDS and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: >Armor Alley >Spectre >Spaceward Ho! and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like ""the grace period is about to end"" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.  Disclaimer number 3: I don't speak for Apple, just me.  -Steve Bollinger ",comp.sys.mac.hardware

Well, looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various places at the same time, which would indicate that this was a planned action. I'm sure FBI and BATF didn't *deliberately* start a possible fire, having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier  method.

I would     be intrested in them.  hehehe  Are these 2 chip or 8 chip     devices what speed?

It is getting boring  |looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows.  So,  |I am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file  |I can share.  Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for  |some bmp files, like some scenery files, some animals files,  |etc....  I used to have some, unfortunately i delete them all.  |  |Anyway could me give me some help, please???  |  	In response to a ""different"" kinda wallpaper, here's what I use.  I think the original gif/whatever was called ""not_real"".  The  artist name and logo is in the lower right corner.  You will need VGA I think, and I have this sized for 800x600 256 color screens.  Use this in your Windows directory and do not tile it.  Hope you enjoy.

The ability to program was >an entry requirement.  At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming)  start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000  assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and  Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company  for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special  Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).   The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering  (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing  Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where  students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an  outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change  suddenly).   In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and  exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a  30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework  assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?  BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).

What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring 	Where do I buy stuff?   Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers  	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not 	electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If 	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't 	do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician, 	or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke; 	mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.  	Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National 	Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC). 	To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail 	with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections 	simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong, 	we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!  	The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the 	force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others, 	however, do not.  Check your with your local building 	department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in 	Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also, 	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements 	for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that 	we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family 	residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial 	establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different 	rules.  	Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in 	some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary 	of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada. 	Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line 	frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number 	of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've 	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or 	``CEC''.  	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often 	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.  Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?  	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the 	National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group. 	It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released. 	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly 	at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the 	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged 	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses. 	And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized 	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the 	recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for 	the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive -- 	US$65 plus shipping and handling.  Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?  	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up 	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance 	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations. 	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two 	or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments, 	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book. 	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified 	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA 	standard itself.  In this FAQ, ""CEC"" really means the 	appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is 	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th 	edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th 	edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an 	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.  	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical 	inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In 	Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't 	overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I 	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the 	equivalent NEC publications.  	Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout 	the province.  Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?  	In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring. 	In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical 	inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's 	homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do 	wiring in ""commercial"" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes) 	are usually considered ""semi-commercial"" or ""commercial"".  However, 	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial 	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can 	find one willing to supervise.  	If you do your own wiring, an important point:  	Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better 	job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home, 	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make 	a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills 	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job. 	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that 	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable, 	and will impress the inspector.  	The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to 	earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your 	time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners. 	Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely 	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.  	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.  	Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip 	wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector 	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it 	takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of 	12ga wire through your hand that way.  	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C 	or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types 	become very brittle.  Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?  	First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few 	screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're  	lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved 	devices) you need Robertson (""square recess"") screwdrivers 	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.  	For drilling a few holes, a 3/4"" or 1"" spade bit and 1/4"" or 	3/8"" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or 	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2"" drill 	(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and 	3/4"" or 1"" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull 	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even 	in 90 year old hardwood timbers.  	Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you 	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws 	work well). 	 	For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or 	ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart ""combo stripper, 	crimper and bottle opener"" types.  You should expect to pay 	$15 to $20 for a good ""plier-type"" pair.  It will have sized 	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should 	be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the 	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There 	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't 	necessary, and pros usually don't use them.  	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends 	in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.  	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.  	You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling 	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire 	loops with a ""loop former hole"" on your wire stripper - more 	accurate.  	If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for 	removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the 	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers, 	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a 	""zipper"", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip 	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to 	slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley 	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades) 	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility 	that you'll gouge the conductors.  	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well 	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18). 	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire 	or the insulation.  	Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired 	outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more 	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple 	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated 	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost 	about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.  	You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are 	dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3) 	and work well.  If you get more serious, a ""audible alarm"" type is 	good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known 	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)  	For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape. 	Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or 	a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.  	Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent 	wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for 	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap  	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination 	screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to 	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet 	that has no cover plate).  Subject: What is UL listing?  	The UL stands for ""Underwriters Laboratory"".  It used to be 	an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent 	and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment 	for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means 	that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements 	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily 	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just 	that it probably won't kill you.  	The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are 	permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However, 	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will 	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to 	the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in 	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component 	used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose. 	Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring 	must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or 	occupancy permits issued. 	 Subject: What is CSA approval?  	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the 	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in 	Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done 	with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to 	the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is 	required by law.  	Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved 	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the 	claim.  	In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC 	(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to 	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance 	companies.  Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?  	USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers  	    Residential Wiring 	    by Jeff Markell, 	    Craftsman Books, 	    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.  	    Practical Electrical Wiring 	    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National 	    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70 	    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan 	    McGraw-Hill Book Co.  	    Wiring Simplified 	    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan 	    Park Publishing Co. 	 	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC 	revision.  Which is currently 1990.  	Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called 	""Electrical Code Simplified"".  There appears to be a version 	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the 	appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring, 	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get 	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer 	questions on the net ;-).  	It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is 	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.  Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?  	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and 	inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more 	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not 	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections 	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors 	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose 	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.  	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your 	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a 	permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about 	this.  	If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at 	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage 	claims.  	In general, the process goes like this: 		- you apply to your local inspections office or building 		  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or 		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is 		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not 		  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose 		  special conditions on you, require loading 		  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point 		  they will tell you which inspections you will need. 		- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to 		  have the panel and service connections inspected 		  before your power utility will provide a connection. 		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority 		  rather than the usual inspectors. 		- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before 		  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a 		  ""rough-in"" inspection. 		- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete, 		  you will need a ""final inspection"".  Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations. 	Do I have to upgrade?  	In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings, 	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some 	cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the 	latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you 	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all 	of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.  Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240  	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the 	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of 	a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V 	or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same 	thing...  In North America the utility companies are required 	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house. 	This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there 	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not 	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped 	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially 	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number 	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness, 	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers. 	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them ""110V"" and 	""220V"", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will 	be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.  	One thing that might make this a little more understandable 	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V 	instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device 	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that 	low.  	208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between 	phases of a 3-phase ""Y"" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any 	hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase ""Y"" 	circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.  	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended 	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...  Subject: What does an electrical service look like?  	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the 	main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility 	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.   	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded  	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes  	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where 	the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic 	action conductivity ""breaks"" (often between copper and iron pipe)). 	This is the ""grounding conductor"".  It is there to make sure that 	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire 	normally carries no current.  	One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or 	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire. 	It is connected to the ""centre tap"" (CEC; ""center tap"" in the 	NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It 	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often 	inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected 	anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.  	Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in 	a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode. 	These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral 	at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional 	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house 	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.  	If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually 	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are 	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one 	neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations  	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do 	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your 	inspector.  	The other two wires will usually be black, and are the ""hot"" 	wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as 	well.  	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each 	other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires, 	the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the 	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.  	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them. 	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected 	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one 	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some 	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only 	service).  Subject: What is a circuit?  	Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires. 	These connections are then used to supply power to selected 	portions of the home.  There are three different combinations: 		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit. 		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit. 		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral, 		   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.  	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and 	lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying 	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they 	often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several 	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is 	usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or 	air conditioners.  	[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar 	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there 	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral 	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing 	the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead 	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel. 	When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles 	are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but 	the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC, 	and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to 	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is 	permissible.]  	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot, 	white for neutral, and bare for grounding.  	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a 	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.  	You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground 	wire.  Since the white is ""hot"" in this case, both the NEC and CEC 	requires that the white wire be ""permanently marked"" at the ends 	to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail 	polish or sometimes electrical tape.  	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the 	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.  	There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2) 	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places 	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is ""frame ground"", 	the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an 	alternative to GFCI protection.  Subject: ""grounding"" versus ""grounded"" versus ""neutral"".  	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the 	""grounding"" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green 	or bare wire.  The word ""neutral"" is reserved for the white when 	you have a circuit with more than one ""hot"" wire.  Since the white 	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the 	panel, the proper term is ""grounded conductor"".  However, the 	potential confusion between ""grounded conductor"" and ""grounding 	conductor"" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should 	never use the bare wire as a ""grounded conductor"" or white wire 	as the ""grounding conductor"", even though they are connected 	together in the panel.  	[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground 	separately from the main panel.  Usually.]  	In the trade, and in common usage, the word ""neutral"" is used 	for ""grounded conductor"".  This FAQ uses ""neutral"" simply to 	avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use ""neutral"" 	too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light 	switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.  Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?  	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power 	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For 	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should 	""trip"", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As 	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the 	wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the 	equipment itself won't cause a fire.  	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt 	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby 	interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively 	fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have 	large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use 	a ""time-delay"" fuse (one brand is ""fusetron"") which will avoid 	tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a 	spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be 	replaced.  	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They 	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched 	into position against another contact.  When the current flow 	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip 	heats up and bends.  By bending it ""trips"" the latch, and the 	spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave 	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to 	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high 	overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite 	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown 	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which 	damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in 	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the 	purpose.  	Neither fuses nor breakers ""limit"" the current per se.  A dead 	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even 	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which 	can often cause severe damage.  Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?  	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher 	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually 	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts 	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse 	being installed, or the proverbial ""replace the fuse with a 	penny"" trick.  	Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better 	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.  	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When 	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting 	path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel, 	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical 	distribution transformer and having your house burn down. 	Breakers don't do this.  	Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit 	fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new 	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special 	inserts to ""key"" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)  	Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse 	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse 	is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the 	labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently 	installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you 	if you need one.  Subject: What size wire should I use?  	For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit, 	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run, 	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid 	voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than 	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.  	Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for 	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or 	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate 	heat easily:  		Gauge		Amps 		14		15 		12		20 		10		30 		8		40 		6		65 	 	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent 	on the application and precise wire type.  Subject: Where do these numbers come from?  	There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup. 	The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When 	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is 	more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need 	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in 	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long 	runs.  	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances. 	There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller 	wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most 	lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits 	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger 	wire.  Subject: What does ""14-2"" mean?  	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors 	in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second 	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but 	remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  ""14-2"" means 	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.  	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes 	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In 	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.  	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire. 	Usually carrying 220V with neutral.  Subject: What is a ""wirenut""/""marrette""/""marr connector""?  How are they 	used?  	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used 	to connect wires together.  ""Marrette"" or ""Marr connector"" 	are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.  	In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them 	together, then twist the wirenut on.  	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the 	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically 	secure.  	There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check 	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the 	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.  	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or 	your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (""linesman"") pliers, 	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes 	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it 	goes in the wirenut properly.  	Some people wrap the ""open"" end of the wirenut with electrical 	tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may 	tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because 	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead 	of taping it, the connection should be redone.  Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?  	A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures 	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the 	neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the 	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other 	path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of 	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any 	of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking 	the circuit.  	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If, 	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral 	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI 	wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot 	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the 	GFCI happy.  	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric. 	One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed 	*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be 	protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices 	downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be 	covered by a single GFCI outlet.  Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?  	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase 	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages, 	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or 	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water 	or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets, 	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'', 	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and 	laundry appliances.  	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there 	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or 	basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you 	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to 	outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.  	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may 	want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI 	breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI 	outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in 	Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your 	finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children? 	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does 	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?  Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?  	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a 	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run 	unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers, 	and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs 	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that 	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary 	current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most 	GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no 	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring 	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.  Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?  	For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the 	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with 	a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI 	breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE 	breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one 	major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch 	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire), 	such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a 	multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive; 	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on 	what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such 	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.  	One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use 	an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use 	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.  	Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one 	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't 	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first 	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet 	in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But 	protecting the whole circuit is preferred.  	When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little 	""ground fault protected"" stickers that come with it and mark 	the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which 	outlets are ""downstream"", simply by tripping the GFCI with the 	test button and see which outlets are dead.  Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?  	Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on, 	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without 	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against 	insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of 	the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an 	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the 	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly 	trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not 	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if 	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of 	course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very 	tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace 	ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).  	There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In 	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with 	exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating 	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will 	happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock; 	the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were 	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to 	ground...  Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization  	Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the 	other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!) 	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot. 	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the 	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to 	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).  	Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.  	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right 	way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the 	narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the 	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral. 	If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which 	prong the terminating screw connects to.  Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?  	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance 	circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex 	receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more 	than 24"" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider 	than 12"" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet. 	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except 	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits 	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, 	lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be 	protected by a GFCI (NEC only).  	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab 	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to 	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet. 	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When 	""carrying through"" to another outlet, the neutral must be 	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral 	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect 	from downstream outlets.  Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?  	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to 	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in 	the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.  Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?  	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire. 	Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM. 	This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside 	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject 	to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are 	wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several 	different categories of NM cable.  	BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or ""AC"" has a 	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is 	fairly resistant to damage.  	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic 	sheath. 	 	Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable 	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer 	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25"" (CEC & NEC) 	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected 	from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of 	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.  	[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored 	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection, 	but this is technically illegal.]  	Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the 	Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague 	references to ""exposed to mechanical damage"" in both the NEC 	and CEC):  	    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage 	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls 	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor. 	      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc. 	    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces 	      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian 	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet 	      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable 	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to ""jump"" to the appliance. 	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used. 	    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating 	      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by 	      means of a 25mm/1"" air space, or suitable insulation 	      material (a wad of fiberglass). 	    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box 	      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'. 	      Holes in joists or studs are considered ""supports"". 	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to 	      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation, 	      it is permitted where ""proper"" support is impractical] 	    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge. 	      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring 	      to the ""workmanship"" clause, but this seems more honoured 	      in the breach...] 	    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or 	      similar finish. 	    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards. 	    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists 	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more 	      than 1m (39"").  	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small 	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to 	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through 	the insulation.  	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by 	solid wall coverings.  	In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of 	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a 	UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of 	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the 	wire.  	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.  	In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will 	need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like 	very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of 	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground 	wiring section.]   	Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be  	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that  	purpose.  	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through 	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed 	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this 	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses 	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building. 	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas. 	  	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,  	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the  	temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: ""AC90"" versus ""AC"". 	In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.  	NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes 	most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*. 	There are very different requirements for mobile homes. 	Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything 	that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable 	only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box 	itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic 	boxes don't use metal cable clamps.  	The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable 	armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still 	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also 	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.  	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for 	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground 	connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other 	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For 	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.  Subject: Junction box positioning?  	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.  	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible 	later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction 	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may 	get nasty.  Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?  	In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few 	caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage 	rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half 	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire 	back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle 	constraints as well.  For example, older house 	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess 	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the 	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results. 	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high 	temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your 	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case 	replacing any devices is a real adventure.)  	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some 	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and 	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy 	chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box 	specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling 	joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available 	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and 	mounted between the joists.  	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as 	""pot"" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated 	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard. 	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated 	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a ""coffin"" (usually 	8'x16""x12"" - made by making a pair of joists 12"" high, and covering 	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet* 	long)  	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3"" 	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation. 	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement, 	which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile. 	Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't 	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector 	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get 	accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown 	in later.]  	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and 	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are 	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat 	more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should 	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses. 	Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location 	for the sensor can vary.  	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved 	for use in insulation.  The ""coffin"" appears the only legal approach.  Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?  	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is 	loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up 	being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with 	respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can 	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in 	some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions 	require the stove frame connected to neutral).  	If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately 	and have them come and check out the problem.  	Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with 	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A 	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness 	far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.  Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?  	Three phase power has three ""hot"" wires, 120 degrees out of 	phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors 	because it is more ""efficient"", provides a bit more starting torque, 	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.  	You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows 	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between 	any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal 	220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the 	two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.  	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually 	ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you 	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to 	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is 	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have 	a ""capacitor start"" unit, or use a larger motor as a 	(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if 	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to 	replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an 	article on how to do this if you must.  	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using 	such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.  Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?  	Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there 	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply 	wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times 	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also 	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor 	will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the 	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.  	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more 	than 50 feet long.  Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?  	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746 	watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies, 	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200 	watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor, 	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational 	efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.  	Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router 	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far 	in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a ""stall 	horsepower"" or similar.  That means the power is measured when 	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load. 	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that 	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker 	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far 	more current than it can continuously.  	When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This 	should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure, 	check the amperage rating, which is always present.  Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?  	Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead 	of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety 	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither 	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.  	There are several different approaches to solving this: 	    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the 	       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect 	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle 	       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise. 	    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and 	       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can 	       run a conductor to it from the third prong. 	    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel. 	    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug 	       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI 	       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI 	       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong 	       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets, 	       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it 	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault 	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected 	       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't 	       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath 	       on BX cable.  	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three 	prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop. 	Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.  Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets? 	Should the test button work?  	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though, 	that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's 	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE 	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current 	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI. 	This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require 	a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press 	the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again: 	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially 	dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.  	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground 	wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The 	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the 	formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never 	tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand, 	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device 	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded 	outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are 	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician 	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require 	it, and promised to investigate.)  Subject: How should I wire my shop?  	As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all 	devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies 	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the 	circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for 	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or 	shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have 	big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp 	breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles 	which means you'd have to ""replug"" all your equipment.  Lights 	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared 	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two 	separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a 	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand 	RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.  	Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the 	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable. 	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each 	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same 	time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and 	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have 	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit 	wrong.  	Note that some jurisdictions have a ""no horizontal wiring"" 	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used 	for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be 	run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.  	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V 	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits. 	Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you 	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled 	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of 	the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much 	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)  	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel, 	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop 	wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to 	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock. 	If you want to install individual switches to ``safe'' 	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough. 	For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to 	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy 	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.  	Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished 	basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And 	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop 	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might 	have a different idea.  	Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop 	wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.  Subject: Underground Wiring  	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use 	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic 	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots 	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion 	of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is 	generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically 	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets, 	fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion 	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And 	of course, don't forget the GFCIs.  	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to 	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about 	your specific situation.  	A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says ""buried power 	line"" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.  Subject: Aluminum wiring  	During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became 	quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time, 	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires, 	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations. 	We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new 	wiring.  	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum 	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper. 	Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper 	installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential 	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.  	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as 	""cold creep"".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When 	it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes 	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each 	time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes 	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance 	of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/ 	oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot, 	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even 	cause a fire.  	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move 	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of 	safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing 	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you 	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring 	for the following things:  	    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to 	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will 	       be stamped with ""Al/Cu"" or ""CO/ALR"".  The latter supersedes 	       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat 	       more expensive than the ordinary ones.  	    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around 	       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be 	       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the 	       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug 	       up each connection.  	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the 	       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.  	    3) ""push-in"" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire. 	       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with 	       the proper screw connections immediately.  	    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections, 	       melted insulation, or ""baked"" fixtures.  Any such damage should 	       be repaired. 	     	    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be 	       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the 	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting 	       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be 	       connected together using special crimp devices, with an 	       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter 	       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless 	       you can rent the tool.  	    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring 	       by means of a short copper ""pigtail"".  See (5) above. 	     	    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped 	       (not nicked) wire etc.      	If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring 	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider 	the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places, 	we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used, 	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having 	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch. 	You can do this yourself too.  Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?  	Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire 	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas. 	Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an 	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor 	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any 	minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many 	places, we suggest you look elsewhere.  	Here's some hints on what to look for:  	Obvious non-code wiring can include:  		- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls 		- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without 		  proper marking. 		- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of 		  a GFCI) 		- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube) 		- Switched neutrals 		- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines  	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one 	time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:  		- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps 		   not properly terminated wiring) 		- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are 		  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when 		  it's *really* convenient ;-) 		- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations 		- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps 		- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them 		- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or 		  ceiling 		- Backwrapped grounding wires  Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring 	 	In the years since Edison ""invented"" electricity, several different 	wiring ""styles"" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you 	may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old  	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.  	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called 	""knob and tube"" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with 	a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural 	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs). 	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections 	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping 	with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately, 	the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs 	down the centre of each room, with ""taps"" off to each fixture. 	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some 	cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same 	colour as the hot wires.  	You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.  	Comments on K&T:  		- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about 		  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good. 		- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up 		  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in 		  quite good condition. 		- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install. 		- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with 		  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either, 		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry. 		- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between 		  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to 		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on 		  any circuit. 		- Building code does not permit insulation in walls 		  that contain K&T. 		- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be 		  tricky.  Consult your inspector. 		- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more 		  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did. 	 	Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't 	necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should 	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and 	be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly 	reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on 	new circuits using modern techniques. 	 	After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type 	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks 	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was 	used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor. 	It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback 	is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole 	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at 	a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.  	This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if 	the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as 	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it. 	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several 	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink 	tubing.  	After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented. 	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky. 	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard 	and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be 	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the ""modern"" stuff - 	thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.  Subject: Where do I buy stuff?  	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their 	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or 	DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety 	including the ""odd"" stuff, and have people behind the counter that 	know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable 	sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information. --  Chris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541 Psroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca Ferret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca ",sci.electronics

"  Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are  finally moving in the right direction.  They should finish over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race  in August.  However, I would take back a few moves:  1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.     I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a     great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year,      but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield     isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?       JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and     immediately have the impact that he has had so far on      the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid     hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be      a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What     about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks     have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years     older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as     before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan      who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take      Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two     promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with     Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling     Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts     only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George     forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that     Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the     Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.  2.  Wade Boggs.     I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is      winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop     a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).     Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about     Charlie Hayes, huh?  3.  Spike Owen.     See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri     or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is     going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys     are on the down sides of their careers.  4.  Danny Tartabull.     Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think     about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he     never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,     Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing     left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists     last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.  What I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right direction but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should (at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This means getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they  will be ready in a year or two.    I'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner. Certainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any time (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first, then add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep them).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle the terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee organization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for example).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all enjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball hell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!

Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of.  For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food, packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects.  Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his* sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.                      --Dianne Murray    wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca  ",sci.med

Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a  different SS.  Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?

At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: ""Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published"".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about ""the third man"" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  ""During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner"", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, ""There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  ""However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.""  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  ""The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret"", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, ""We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter"".  ""The Union is aware"", says Shiffman, ""of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  ""The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...""  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  ""Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.""  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: ""Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.""  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: ""The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.""  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: ""I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.""  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  ""A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security"".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  ""Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  ""Nevertheless"", adds Shtendal, ""the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.""  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: ""As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances."" -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu ",talk.politics.mideast

"       Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells.

"      Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:  Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100     Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like ""Bure"" ""Konstantinov"" and ""Borshevshky"". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).       Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This ""European mystique"" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.      I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.      I just don't want them on mine.       --  Richard J.

The kind of interpretation I see as ""incredibly perverse"" is that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape.

And such were  >some of you...""  I Cor. 6:9-11.  The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_ in this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of activity that could be named by ""fornication"" or ""theft"" or ""coveting"" or ""reviling"" or ""drunkenness"" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all ""clear"" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions, with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated Christian discussion of ALL these areas.  Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly ""harmless"" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual -- that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]  	""'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything 	is for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one 	will not let anything make free with me.""  [1 Cor. 6:12]  Which is a restatement that we must have no other ""god"" before God.  A commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior. It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.  I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially. Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of which Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine them.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are ""moral"" and which ones are ""ritual.""  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep). And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus from the ""ritual law"" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.  I'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this matter) about how ""repulsive"" and ""unnatural"" our acts are -- and what do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating insects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part of the ritual law?  For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can be ""law"" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about) it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to determine why you ""pick"" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the whole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: ""No doubt I am free to do anything."" But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this, the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go through Leviticus and decide each ""command"" there on that basis, then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this context, it is remarkably offensive to say:  >I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the >verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.  Well, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously (though one can always find jokers) in ""defense"" of bestiality.  It is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do* raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not mine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so.  Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length, the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ- ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.  Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is.  Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ. WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor? God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.  Why, for God's sake?  	""For God did not send the Son into the world 	to condemn the world, 	but that the world might be saved through him. 	Whoever believes in him is not condemned, 	but whoever does not believe has already been condemned 	for refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son. 	Now the judgment is this: 	the light has come into the world, 	but men have preferred darkness to light 	because their deeds were evil. 	For everyone who practices wickedness 	hates the light, 	and does not come near the light 	for fear his deeds will be exposed. 	But he who acts in truth 	comes into the light, 	so that it may be sh0own 	that his deeds are done in God.""	John 3:17-21  For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do* show a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.  However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity; and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us. --  Michael L.

By the 1920s, there was a very active ""good roads"" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco ""America on the Road"" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called ""The Devil Wagon in God's Country"" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.

As I understood it, MSG *is* natural.  Isn't it found in  tomatoes?  Anyway, lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural things; peanuts, onions, tomatoes, milk, etc.  Just because something is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks.  As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor has an ulcer.  People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these things cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them? How should food be tasted?  Isn't it better left to the diner?  Julie DISCLAIMER:  All opinions here belong to my cat and no one else ",sci.med

"Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  Just a quick comment.  As a baptist clergyperson, I find the idea of such a ""baptism"" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and they seldom are regarding religion) offensive.  The pastor here seems to have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent.  We do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearing the word is likely to be a convert.  If in fact the grace of God might work in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day or two.  Baptist believe in regenerate membership.  Did this church include these half-baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship? Or do they somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose?  This kind of ""evangelism"" is certainly not baptist, and probably not very christian, either.  revdak@netcom.com ",soc.religion.christian

There are 3 alternatives: 1.

I have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no info whatsoever to tell me.  I have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles and a few ""safety""  (funny that most of my safety schools were the first to reject me)  my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WR I couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art history, politics etc   Ive done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab work for years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience.  I cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. What percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average?

"NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu  Here is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed. Previously I had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.  Your mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far. I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds.  Parts  	Clock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of 	speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the 	oscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend 	getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.  	   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for 	   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:  		   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121) 		   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136) 		   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)  	   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.  	   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a 	   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's) 	    	Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as 	   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins 	   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.  	Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a  	   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had 	   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which 	   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up  	   something similar or risk frying your CPU. 	    Procedure  1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.  2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static     precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do     this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from 	the back of the mac.   3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.     The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power     supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you     need release.   4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon     SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable     leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.     The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed     to release it.                                              5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount  6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A     phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop     it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful     here.  7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the     right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding 	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then 	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.  8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic     device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle, 	rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release. 	 9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to     free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case. 	 10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of     the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic 	Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The 	motherboard then comes directly out. 	 11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the     CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators 	must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation. 	 	Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of 	the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure 	your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board. 	 	I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is 	NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is 	a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without 	proper care. 	 12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.  13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the 	old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the 	socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new 	50 mhz clock. 	 14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification. 	 14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.  15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother     board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard. 	 16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into 	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.     Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks     into place. 	 17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY     DRIVE CABLE.  18) Replace the phillips head screw  19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.  20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.  21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn      on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't, 	something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your 	handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences. 	 	Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and 	replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and 	be astounded.  	 	You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding 	a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up 	might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since 	modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single 	problem. 	 Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real risk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than $50 in parts.

" Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:    I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in  designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity""  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life""  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.    So what's the point?    L.

I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  First use the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions.  Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will remind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have three transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month, middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.  Mike ",comp.os.ms-windows.misc

At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.  I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians ""Creation Science"" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then ""interpret"" passages to match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of Nostradamus all the time.

The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, is that there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and buses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is no place to park.  Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administration wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide his or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan.  	Also, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only car manufacturer in Korea.  Daewoo has always manufactured cars and I believe Kia is back in business as well.  Imported cars, such as Mercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still quite expensive.  	Finally, please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics and bureaucracy.  He's quite uninformed. --  T. H.

" It is interesting to note in the past few days' correspondance that some believe that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial space launch business.  For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not.  The 'spaceport political publicity' referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of dual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch, don't think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions with the MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm, believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar.  I believe that all will happen this summer and don't worry, the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it does occur. Stephen Horan shoran@nmsu.edu ",sci.space

" Here's a suggestion for the logical argument FAQ.  I don't think it's covered, though the fallacy probably has a better name than the one I used:  How about it, mathew?  INCONSISTENCY AND COUNTEREXAMPLE  This occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes stand A, which is inconsistent with B.  There are two variations in which B is either a mutually-agreed-on premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same source.  The second party fallaciously responds by saying ""see, the source really does say B, it's right here!""; this reply does not refute the allegation of inconsistency because it does not show that the source _only_ says B.

This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual >world.    This was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.  It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and thus he became the ""Elevator of the heavens.""  This ""god"" made men able to ""feel"" as if heaven were afar off and ""as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws.""  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled ""Emancipator"" or ""Deliverer""  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true.  >The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is >an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to consign Adam >or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to the coming ""Anointed One"" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it as a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else.  >It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The >relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely >extended conditions of Greenwich mean time.   I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal life is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of consciousness.    >It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous >were lost.   It depends upon your def of ""lost.""  The elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world.  Existentially we were all born ""lost"", but the ""righteous"" were ""in Christ"" and therefore never *assuredly* lost.   > >It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient >people's ideas of life after death.

Our understanding, of say eschatology, is clearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring to.  >(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf >Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my >views on this subject).  >The way you refer to it as ""doctrine"" puts a modern intellectual coloring >on it.

However, I would say, again I think, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it.  Look at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very interesting study.   >The similarity in the midst of great variety of >expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately >after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  Yes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as ""mystery"" religions for no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light. The ""Mystery of Iniquity"" that we find in the Bible, correlates to this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately, little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point today might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in Egypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the ""husband son."")  >On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity >that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the >human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is >created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas >dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does >today.  No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the church, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their worldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you are a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to expound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also the trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's ""Egyptians.""  He really does a number on what the Greeks did to what they ""pilfered"" from the Egyptians.   > He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same >time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our >eternal spiritual being had grown dim.  I'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.  Its just that ""there is nothing new under the sun.""   >Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal >irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in >which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a >single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the >reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in >terms that did not try to spell it out.  Each age has its own focus of theology.  The early church struggled with the Trinitarian formulation.  The reformation dealt with authority.  Today, eschatology has had much study.  The early creeds do not spell these things out in detail because, 1) they weren't the topic of concern, 2) there was insufficient wisdom accumulated, 3) they didn't have the exegetical tools that we have today.  Also, each age seems to have an air of revelation to it.  One age has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is given growth.  It would be natural for the end of times to have the garden appropriate for the growth of eschatology, wouldn't it? > tangents, never ending tangents, Rex ",soc.religion.christian

I am puzzled by the term ""concept."" Drag free may already have been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously adjusting its position to compensate for drag.
